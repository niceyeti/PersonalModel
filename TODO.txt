Gleason TODO's:
  --test models on multiple enron emailers
  --try different parameters for distance function
  --with PYTHON generate measurements of recency promotion: minus stop words, see if recency is really 
    a meaningful attribute for caching, or if its just noise, eg, do words recur w/in distance x of one another?
    Note that the cluster metric should also provide a degenerate form of this information, since recency is really
    something like a skewed exponential distribution (or other time-based distribution)

  ensemble: personal + general

  -how to anonymize emailers: just use a number, alias, etc. Reference is invertible anyway.
