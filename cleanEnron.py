"""
This pyscript does cleaning and outputting on an enron directory of emails. So
given a prolific emailer in the enron dataset, clean their sent emails, and write them to 
an output directory. We just want to build a large, clean dataset of someone's personal language
model; the added benefit of the enron emails is that they contain attributes such as time-of-day,
addressee(s), and so on. The downside is the dataset is so full of business language and a lot of
character and formatting noise; so the dataset is inherently difficult to parse well, with the additional
difficulty of the language complexity used by corporate executives in a legal, engineering, and business context.

Outputs file into a structured form:
  To: A list of recipients
  Subject: A topic
  DateTime: A datetime field (don't expect much from this attribute)
  Body: Body of email, including the subject line, so we get that context as well.
  
Essentially this script outputs each email as a vector of key:vals.

The filters here are ad hoc, and based on a lot of manual ajustment. But they are very good, best so far for the
noisy-as-heck enron set.
