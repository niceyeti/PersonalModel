Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance 
starting at DATENUMERIC a.m. on Tuesday, September INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This requires 
that the "wet gas" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.

CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by DATENUMERIC p.m. will result in CNGT 
considering 
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your 
As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult 
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your 
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's 
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators 
notify producers in their pool of this shut in. DATENUMERIC CNGT will not notify 
producers individually. 
We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this. DATENUMERIC I also wanted 
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us 
to avoid shutting down the plant next year. DATENUMERIC The next regularly scheduled

Hey team! DATENUMERIC I probably won't be here when these are due. DATENUMERIC After you finish

Index worksheets 
I have some suggested Gas Daily pricing on the attached. DATENUMERIC I will discuss this 
with Charlie. 
Gas Daily Pricing for April 
Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items: 
INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month 
changes does appear to be an issue. DATENUMERIC Since the contract didn't spell out in 
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we 
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly 
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. DATENUMERIC I know Chris 
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not 
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. DATENUMERIC I will ask that he forward 
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. DATENUMERIC Let me know if 
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Local production DATENUMERIC unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms 
here. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Here is what is happening: DATENUMERIC Your people are nominating this 
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), 
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. DATENUMERIC That 
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC We are 
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between 
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual 
contract prices with the producers. DATENUMERIC So, this is one issue we will have to 
address as indemnification items. DATENUMERIC That's problem one. DATENUMERIC Problem two is that I 
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all 
the nominations. DATENUMERIC We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is 
what you want). DATENUMERIC For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the 
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from 
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I'll 
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Monthly invoices DATENUMERIC regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like 
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the 
pipeline invoices on to you. DATENUMERIC Maybe we should change this process to one 
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his 
confirmation and review of all the charges. DATENUMERIC This means you may see quite a 
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. DATENUMERIC Let us know what 
you would prefer. DATENUMERIC Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that 
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to 
your office yesterday, March DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Chris will get all remaining demand charge 
statements to your office by Wednesday, April INTNUMERIC and all corrections he is 
aware of as of this date by Friday, April DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I apologize for the delay. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Swap confirmations DATENUMERIC I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a 
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on 
Monday. DATENUMERIC Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? DATENUMERIC If not, please 
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data. 
Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory 
I forgot the storage attachment DATENUMERIC

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our

please let me know. DATENUMERIC I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for 
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron. 
Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to 
discuss. DATENUMERIC Below is a brief description of each. DATENUMERIC Please let me know how you 
think we could best deal with these DATENUMERIC whether it's via phone call or having an 
in-person meeting down in your office. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Pricing DATENUMERIC I left you a message about this last week. DATENUMERIC According to Chris 
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated. 
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using 
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Consistency DATENUMERIC During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some 
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to 
intra-month changes. DATENUMERIC I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing 
mechanism and then apply it consistently. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Local production DATENUMERIC Apparently there was local production that John Singer 
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not 
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. DATENUMERIC We need to discuss how to 
handle this production. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Monthly invoices DATENUMERIC We still haven't seen the complete January DATENUMERIC 
invoice. DATENUMERIC As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over, 
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. DATENUMERIC Also, 
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested 
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Swap confirmations DATENUMERIC For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place 
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not 
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. DATENUMERIC Rich Contos and I 
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we 
can't seem to find the right person over there. 
Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Pricing DATENUMERIC I left you a message about this last week. DATENUMERIC According to Chris 
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated. 
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using 
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Consistency DATENUMERIC During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some 
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to 
intra-month changes. DATENUMERIC I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing 
mechanism and then apply it consistently. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Local production DATENUMERIC Apparently there was local production that John Singer 
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not 
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. DATENUMERIC We need to discuss how to 
handle this production. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Monthly invoices DATENUMERIC We still haven't seen the complete January DATENUMERIC 
invoice. DATENUMERIC As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over, 
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. DATENUMERIC Also, 
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested 
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Swap confirmations DATENUMERIC For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place 
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not 
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. DATENUMERIC Rich Contos and I 
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we 
can't seem to find the right person over there. 
Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

I'm going to Jay Blaine's taylor at DATENUMERIC PM, maybe after. 
Is meredith buying us a drink tomorrow ? 
Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under DATENUMERIC desk, Market East and East. DATENUMERIC All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk. 
All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East. 
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East. DATENUMERIC So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.

Hey Jennifer and Dale, 
I checked with Scott Neal and Dick Jenkins and they're on board with having 
all DATENUMERIC trading locations available for our customers starting April on EOL (if 
possible with you guys of course). DATENUMERIC The DATENUMERIC existing locations are CNG SABINE 
NORTH POINT & CNG SABINE SOUTH POINT and the two new proposed locations will 
be CNG TRANSMISSION TTT SOUTH POOL & CNG TRANSMISSION TTT NORTH POOL. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC There 
may be some confusion among our EOL customers with the similar names to these 
points so we have to be careful how we differentiate the names of the DATENUMERIC 
points. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The Enron trader responsible for the DATENUMERIC new CNG Transmission 
locations will be Scott Hendrickson. DATENUMERIC The business systems director at CNG 
Transmission who requested this of me is Iris King. DATENUMERIC Her phone number is 
onboard with having the locations available to trade on EOL as soon as 
If I can provide any more info.to you, please let me know. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC THANKS AGAIN IN 
ADVANCE!!!!!! 
From: DATENUMERIC Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny 
Thanks for the information. It is good to know people outside of the company 
are wanting additional locations to trade on EOL.

in our group, will coordinate adding these locations 
for EOL trading.

Hey Jennifer, DATENUMERIC How are you? 
We had a meeting with CNG Transmission today. DATENUMERIC They have rolled out a new 
pooling service for their customers called CNG Transmission North pool and 
CNG Transmission South pool. DATENUMERIC It's different than CNG South Point and CNG 
North Point. DATENUMERIC These last two pertain to CNG Sabine Hub Services. DATENUMERIC As they 
have presented these new services to their customers, all of their customers 
are inquiring as to whether or not EOL will be trading these two new 
locations in the future. DATENUMERIC These new services on CNG Transmission have the 
benefit over CNG Sabine Hub Services pools of being free for the time being 
(until October at least)....How do we go about adding these two new trading 
locations on EOL. DATENUMERIC Volumes can be transferred from CNG Sabine Hub Services 
points over to CNG Transmission pools at no cost and we are actually starting 
to set up our supplies and markets in this manner to save on pooling costs 
for April. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I have a contact that you can talk to at CNG Transmission if you 
would like.. Please let me know and thanks in advance!!!!

Actually, my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year 
round. DATENUMERIC This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand 
during the summer. DATENUMERIC Depending on the relationship you would like to have with 
the customer, I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and 
the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport 
(at least with the way things work in our systems). 
It's not Enron's intention to have Calp fund the OPT DATENUMERIC payment. Enron 
would like for Calp to release the capacity in Enron's name during the 
winter period, and this would send the bills directly to Enron and 
eliminate funding by Calp and reimbursement of Enron to Calp. We can look 
at this again next winter. I'm not sure why there was a delayed payment 
once Calp gave Enron the bill a month ago. I'll ask Mark Feldman about wire 
Thanks again for your patience. 
The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt. DATENUMERIC It was 
CALP's intent to fund the OPT DATENUMERIC payment. DATENUMERIC As requested, I will faxed 
bill to Robin. DATENUMERIC Since the January payment is so late, could you have 
January and 
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account? 
Roman and Paulette, 
Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday 
March 24th. As soon as Mark Feldman (Enron payment God) receives February's 
bill, he can pay this one too. 
Thank you for your patience during this transition.

My CES buddy is starting to focus on local production now. DATENUMERIC What's bad is CES

Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG 
Field Services for January. DATENUMERIC The volume is INTNUMERIC MMBtu at a price of DECNUMERIC 
The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson. DATENUMERIC I'm not sure what to tell 
I would have charged them DECNUMERIC for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport). 
In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer). DATENUMERIC Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. DATENUMERIC I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package. DATENUMERIC If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail. DATENUMERIC If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not. DATENUMERIC Thanks. 
Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES? DATENUMERIC This could be a can of worms. 
Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word. 
Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating. 
However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments. 
Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals. DATENUMERIC I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. DATENUMERIC We found a few like 
this on CNG last week. DATENUMERIC The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail. 
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different. DATENUMERIC I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's. 
Wade DATENUMERIC Do you know whether deal DATENUMERIC is pool or a citygate deal? DATENUMERIC If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator. 
Joanie DATENUMERIC Do you have any insight into this? 
I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here. DATENUMERIC Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them. DATENUMERIC My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end. 
Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein. DATENUMERIC I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices. DATENUMERIC I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an

Effective 04/1/2000, Columbia Gas Transmission will be transferring certain 
facilities to Gatherco, Inc. DATENUMERIC There should have been a message in Columbia 
Navigator stating that there were certain meters that were going out of your 
IPP pool DATENUMERIC effective DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The subject for this e-mail message was 
"Appalachian Meter Allocation". DATENUMERIC The meters listed in this e-mail will now be 
on Gatherco's gathering lines and are going to be subject to the DECNUMERIC 
gathering rate. DATENUMERIC Per Dave Fusek at Gatherco, our final estimates for DATENUMERIC 
SHOULD reflect these meters that were changed from Columbia Gas Transmission 
to Gatherco. DATENUMERIC He said he is not DECNUMERIC positive that they will get this 
finished in time, but they are hoping to have everything complete by the time 
they release our nominations. 
Gloria and Wade, 
You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these 
meters. DATENUMERIC Some of these meters were previously subject to Columbia's DECNUMERIC 
gathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any 
gathering. DATENUMERIC Again, these meters will now have a DECNUMERIC gathering charge. 
Please call me if you have any questions.

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS 
contracts. TCO could do an inground storage transfer between Enron and these 
accounts, however storage withdrawal and injection fees would be charged. 
Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn 
from storage for DATENUMERIC March. There is no need to do outside deals to get 
additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just 
changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice.

discussing any aspect of the CES Retail business with EES. DATENUMERIC If you receive 
any calls from EES people about the CES retail business, please inform them 
of this prohibition on discussions. If we receive consent from CEG/Nisource

I'm going to respond to everyone on the email with my comments but I just 
wanted to make sure I undersand the blue highlighted comments below. DATENUMERIC Please 
call me when you get a chance. 
Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES? DATENUMERIC This could be a can of worms. 
Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word. 
Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating. 
However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments. 
Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals. DATENUMERIC I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. DATENUMERIC We found a few like 
this on CNG last week. DATENUMERIC The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail. 
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different. DATENUMERIC I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's. 
Wade DATENUMERIC Do you know whether deal DATENUMERIC is pool or a citygate deal? DATENUMERIC If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator. 
Joanie DATENUMERIC Do you have any insight into this? 
I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here. DATENUMERIC Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them. DATENUMERIC My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end. 
Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein. DATENUMERIC I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on

DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC However, Sitara shows the price index is CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I DECNUMERIC 
Could you please verify which rate should I be using in billing EES? 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC On deal DECNUMERIC I was told by Judy Barn that this is an internal 
(financial) deal, therefore, it did not get downloaded into Settlement. 
However, per Patricia Downey at EES, this is a financial deal that was turned 
physical. DATENUMERIC Would you please also confirm this wherether we should bill EES 
for this deal or not?

I have no contacts to buy from. DATENUMERIC Mountaineer production is normally sold on 
term deals. 
CES needs 17dts/day of Mountaineer gas for the rest of March. DATENUMERIC The request 
was made by Kim Novesak??

Brian, we have DATENUMERIC a deal we can't identify. DATENUMERIC Do you show anything in your 
records about purchasing INTNUMERIC dt's on Jan 20th or 21st? DATENUMERIC It looks like a DATENUMERIC 
day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio. DATENUMERIC The delivery 
point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong. DATENUMERIC The price would be 
somewhere around DECNUMERIC 
Columbia Gas of Ohio on CGAS for Jan DATENUMERIC 
Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio? DATENUMERIC I would like to see it if we do. DATENUMERIC I 
don't show any record of a deal like this. DATENUMERIC I'm going to send an email to my 
CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this. 
Robert Allwein 
Sandra, I just have to get with Chris Germany to see if he can confirm this 
deal. I will keep you posted. Thanks, Rob 
Chris, Deal DECNUMERIC INTNUMERIC Please take a look at this and see if you can confirm 
that this was Buy/Sell or incremental. CES or EES? I have a supply but no 
market. Thanks 
Victor Lamadrid 
Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices. DATENUMERIC I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase. 
Sandra Dial 
Can you change the year from DATENUMERIC to DATENUMERIC on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara DECNUMERIC purchase. 
Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let DATENUMERIC Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it. 
Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system. 
Thanks all. 
Robert Allwein 
The deal ticket has DATENUMERIC on it not DATENUMERIC Can you find out who they sold the 
gas to. Do you need this pathed and tracked and balanced? DATENUMERIC Rob

Robert/Victor, 
Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)... 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

Hey. DATENUMERIC What is your professional opinion about this? DATENUMERIC This was sent to me by

This was the original message Jeff Porter was responding to. 
Just a note to let you know Columbia Gas has some capacity postings on the 
EBB for next winter. DATENUMERIC BIDS ARE DUE DATENUMERIC AT 9AM. 
Attached is a spreadsheet showing the parcel numbers. DATENUMERIC I highlighted the 
meters that you did not have enough capacity to serve your load this winter. 
I would be happy to bid on this as your agent, but let me know what rate 
works based on your economics. DATENUMERIC This is a bid process, so the current low bid 
is just an indication of the market value of the capacity.

contract work for April 1? 
If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 
John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate? 
Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated.

identical in instances where no change has been made. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Where the two numbers 
differ, the Intraday value is the latest requriement. DATENUMERIC In some cases where 
there is storage (i.e., COH Choice) INTNUMERIC you will see negative values for the 
'PRIMARY' requirement. DATENUMERIC This represents a situation where gas is being 
withdrawn from storage and sold at the pool, along with the first-of-the-month

From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say. 
Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
"Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth. 
But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 
I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor! 
A Luv poam 
I wrote this poem for you because of all the work you guys do. 
Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. 
You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 
Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 
Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 
Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say. 
Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth.

Just a note. DATENUMERIC Effective April 1st, we will not have the purchase at St DATENUMERIC or 
the PSNC transport. DATENUMERIC This is a new contract each month DATENUMERIC we are currently 
shipping DATENUMERIC dt's. 
Please see below. 
KIM NOVSEK BIZIK 
Good Afternoon. 
Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany. DATENUMERIC We have one customer 
PSNC. DATENUMERIC Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this 
customer as their expires. DATENUMERIC I just do not want to have a mix up for April and 
have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed. DATENUMERIC I am in 
the process of notifing PSNC. DATENUMERIC Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give 
the option to inform Chris. 
PSNC for April 
Chris--The attached file contains our daily requirements for DATENUMERIC and DATENUMERIC 
Please call me if there is a problem with scheduling the volumes indicated. 
The AGL numbers in this spreadsheet may not be correct and the numbers 
by David Scott to Scott Goodell for today and tomorrow should be used instead 
of the ones shown here. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Later today, around 4PM eastern time, I will send 
an update if there are any changes. 
Doug Kinney 
Daily volumes for DATENUMERIC and DATENUMERIC 
Here are a couple of demand charges I don't understand. DATENUMERIC AGL released CES 
contracts being billed on k#1.3473. DATENUMERIC What's up.

Just to keep you in the loop. DATENUMERIC I have not responed to any of these questions 
try it again 
Jeffrey Porter 
I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to 
determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA, with contract 
details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am 
looking for some of the following; contract DECNUMERIC RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not 
sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you 
please assist? 
DATENUMERIC TCO COH7-1, Exhibit DATENUMERIC shows INTNUMERIC of capacity for C&I. I have no details 
DATENUMERIC TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details. 
DATENUMERIC TCO K#65403- believe it delivers INTNUMERIC to BGE, but need all detail. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC TRANSCO Z5-Ex DATENUMERIC shows DATENUMERIC capacity, I have no details. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA? 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Texas Gas Z-4 to DP&L- monthly also? 
DATENUMERIC Did CES have any ColGulf capacity that was assigned? 
Call me if you have questions. 
Questions about CES Capacity 
Hey Team! DATENUMERIC Ms. DATENUMERIC "Terry" Franklin is part of the team now. DATENUMERIC Make sure you copy 
her on any appalachian/local production issues. DATENUMERIC She will be the one setting 
this up in Sitara in the future. 
I called Jill Linkenauger Friday afternoon... haven't heard back. My plan is 
to talk to her and then Kevin McCracken at CNR to have this agency switch 
over by April 1st. I thought it was done... but not DECNUMERIC sure. 
Hey cats. Sylvia needs to know if we are agent for CES regarding CNR 
contracts. I began setting up the contracts on Friday, but she stopped me in 
the middle cuz she wants to make sure that we are setting them up correctly. 
I have DATENUMERIC to DATENUMERIC to set up. Please let me know what you know. DATENUMERIC Thanks, Rob 
CNR Contracts. 
My network password is "clg03mar" DATENUMERIC ID "cgerman"

Scott misspelled your name. DATENUMERIC I hope I have the right guy. 
I listed one of the CES issues down below. DATENUMERIC The other issue I have is 
pricing. DATENUMERIC I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the 
pricing. DATENUMERIC I will try to get with you this afternoon. DATENUMERIC Just a note, I bet I 
spent at least DATENUMERIC hours on the phone with CES last Friday. 
I talked with Hunter. DATENUMERIC Kevin Rosetti is the man. DATENUMERIC Chris, please bring up to 
speed on how to handle CES. 
Chris Germany 
I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues. 
CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates. DATENUMERIC ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor. DATENUMERIC This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor. DATENUMERIC I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue. 
CES Central Desk Issues 
I wish I could write such sweet words. DATENUMERIC There are starting to be way to many

You left DATENUMERIC TRCO invoice questions on my desk. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Contract DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC this is a volumetric release from PSNC for CES Retail. 
The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Contract DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC ??? DATENUMERIC I don't understand this one. DATENUMERIC Take a look at 
k#1.3473. DATENUMERIC Did we receive a demand charge on DATENUMERIC and not have the demand 
estimated in Sitara? DATENUMERIC I may need to add DATENUMERIC and DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Let me know 
what you find. 
TRCO invoices 
I think this is a Central Desk contract or its one of our agency contract. 
We have so many. DATENUMERIC Do you have a Sitara deal number? 
Sylvia A Campos 
Please see below and advise on the effective date for contract DECNUMERIC or 
should this contract not be used for January business? 
ENA nominated Reliant Energy Field Services contract DATENUMERIC on the third 
party pipe for January business. DATENUMERIC This contract is set up with an effective 
it possible to change the date in the Global Contracts system, or should we 
not have used this contract for January business? 
Thanks for your help. 
Reliant Energy Field Services Contract DATENUMERIC 
Let's see. DATENUMERIC Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say "let me 
know if there is anything I can do to help" get those invoices out. 
Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean "I 
welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract 
and would be overjoyed at pricing the DATENUMERIC plus 1st of the month pricing 
scenarios." 
Jeff W Westover 
Chris, lets meet next Tuesday at DATENUMERIC p.m. (Conference Room EB-3745) to 
discuss the status of the January DATENUMERIC invoice billing (sales & purchase). 
There is still a substantial amount that is not showing up DATENUMERIC in Unify. 
Customer is paying Enron DECNUMERIC million on Monday and we only have DECNUMERIC million 
in the system that is showing up. We sent Columbia a manual invoice for 
February 18th. 
Send me an e-mail back to confirm. 
Thanks, Jeff

A few more questions DATENUMERIC 
What about for the Central Desk volumes? DATENUMERIC Who is going to estimate those ?? 
Who is going to compare March noms with the booked volume on Exhibit ? 
Who is going to physically be the one to enter the deals in Sitara DATENUMERIC TAGG, 
both for Central and East for the remaining term April DATENUMERIC through March 
When will it go into the books ?? 
I discussed CES retail with Chris. He is going to work with Dick on 
estimating a good retail volume to book. 
We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April DATENUMERIC forward) as soon as possible. DATENUMERIC For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it. DATENUMERIC I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a DECNUMERIC 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES. 
Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. DATENUMERIC Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one). DATENUMERIC Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. DATENUMERIC In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up. DATENUMERIC I'll e-mail that list to you separately. 
If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
CES Retail 
I think this is correct. DATENUMERIC We will show it this way for now. DATENUMERIC Can you verify 
what were billed in demand for Oct please. DATENUMERIC No rush.,

Chris--Can you please provide me with a response to Kim's question? 
KIM NOVSEK BIZIK 
Hi. DATENUMERIC Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st. DATENUMERIC I had requested DATENUMERIC dth per day on 
Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler. DATENUMERIC For some reason Chris 
Germany told PSNC to release capacity for DATENUMERIC dth and not DATENUMERIC dth. DATENUMERIC PSNC 
me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled. DATENUMERIC I instructed PSNC to 
contact Chris. DATENUMERIC Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule DATENUMERIC dth 
the first and then drop nom down to DATENUMERIC effective the second. DATENUMERIC I did this. 
This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March 
1st, that only DATENUMERIC dth could be confirmed. DATENUMERIC I called my transco scheduler and 
she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled. 
(impossible as capacity was released to Enron). DATENUMERIC All I wanted was DATENUMERIC dth per 
day for March. DATENUMERIC Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should 
and did get scheduled? DATENUMERIC Thank you.

I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the 
Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian 
Coordinator role. DATENUMERIC Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron 
experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team. 
In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following: 
? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements 
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results 
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts 
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters 
? Create purchase deals in SITARA 
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc. 
? Review calc sheets 
? Maintain purchase pricing 
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co 
Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the 
commercial and operations teams. DATENUMERIC In doing so, she will be looking to partner 
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume 
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very 
important area. 
Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to 
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the DATENUMERIC current 
workload. DATENUMERIC Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we 
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during 
this transition time. 
Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!

Dear Producers and Shippers, 
In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant 
would be permanently shut down on February INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC We heard from many 
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz 
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed. 
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen 
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, 
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until: 
DATENUMERIC it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 
DATENUMERIC CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and 
processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system. 
We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian 
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you. 
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson

We need to add Sonat to our CES retail demand charge sheet. 
Let's chat. 
AGL Sonat capacity 
What have I heard DATENUMERIC just a bunch of complaining. DATENUMERIC She's hugh and she is about 
to go for a walk ON THE 29TH????? DATENUMERIC What is she thinking? 
I didn't even know Bob was out. 
You behave yourself. 
Have you heard anything from Judy? DATENUMERIC Also, did you hear from Bob? DATENUMERIC Have a 
Question 
Latest and greatest. 
Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total 
daily firm load across all DATENUMERIC pools would average INTNUMERIC dth/day. DATENUMERIC This would 
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as 
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing 
gas. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC On days when the firm requirement falls below the INTNUMERIC (for March INTNUMERIC 
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS 
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that 
inventory down to the DECNUMERIC level by March DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Otherwise, we could be liable 
penalties. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary 
and keep drawing the gas out of storage. 
Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further. 
Doug- Based on these numbers David's w/d from IBSS would be zero, due to 
the AGL DSR. 
Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00. 
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you 
yesterday. DATENUMERIC Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly 
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes), 
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were 
picking up the first DATENUMERIC days of March. DATENUMERIC (This spreadsheet was originally 
designed for February, which has DATENUMERIC days.) DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This has been corrected in the 
attached version. 
Sorry for any confusion.

from Pittsburgh and will leave CES at the end of February. CES is outsourcing 
these management responsibilities to Alliance Energy Services. CES has a term 
supply contract with Enron for DATENUMERIC delivered to Union Camp and this expires 
at the end of March DATENUMERIC CES is in agreement that Enron will continue to 
nominate this gas until the end of March DATENUMERIC 
The Contract signed between CES and Enron, states that ENA has the agency 
rights for the International Paper Contract. 
Enron's understanding is that Enron will continue to nominate this contract 
until CES's fuel management responsibilities expire in DATENUMERIC Colleen and 
Melissa, please ensure both companies are on the same page. Fred Lomabardo 
and his boss, Don Deal, were going to outsource the nomination rights of this 
contract to Alliance Energy. This is not allowed per the Contract language. 
In addition, Union Camp does not want to sign the agency agreement required 
by TCO, because it is vague. Enron needs this agreement signed so we can 
nominate the gas under Enron's accounts on TCO. We need CES's help in getting 
this matter resolved ASAP.

Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the state fair every year. Every year 
Stumpy would say, "Martha, I'd like to ride in that there airplane." And 
every year Martha would say, "I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs 
ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars." 
One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, "Martha, I'm 
DATENUMERIC years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get 
another chance." Martha replied, "Stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten 
dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars." 
The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take 
you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not 
say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten 
Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists 
and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks 
over again, but still not a word. 
They land and the pilot turns to Stumpy, "By golly, I did everything I 
could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't." Stumpy replied, 
"Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but ten dollars is 
ten dollars." 
FW: A little flying humor 
Jim asked me to forward this to you. DATENUMERIC We should probably discuss this. 
Transport Rates 
Something for you to consider: 
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the 
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as 
possible. DATENUMERIC This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as 
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible. DATENUMERIC I'm not sure how you or 
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but 
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating 
transport p&l. DATENUMERIC In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are 
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas. DATENUMERIC These could 
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates. DATENUMERIC The 
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index 
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead. 
Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue 
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES 
business in our portfolio, the times have changed. DATENUMERIC Currently we are using 
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport 
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and 
how we are marking the curves. DATENUMERIC For example, today's Gas Daily postings 
compared to our curve markings are as follows: 
GAS DAILY DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC GAS DAILY SPREAD DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES 
Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong. DATENUMERIC There are 
two solutions that I see. DATENUMERIC One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which 
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other 
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more 
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace. DATENUMERIC That's up to you. 
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads 
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know 
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), 
we need to focus on it being accurate. 
Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work 
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations. 
Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling 
CNG North City Gate DECNUMERIC GD CNG North DECNUMERIC 
CNG South City Gate DECNUMERIC Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their 
intra-month curve at. 
TECO Citygate DECNUMERIC GD CGT/App DECNUMERIC 
Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one 
day lag. DATENUMERIC After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any 
derived curves. 
If you have any questions please let me know.

I'm available 
any evening this week. DATENUMERIC Just let me know!

Marde and the Job# as is posted on the Enron company job site (online). 
Just reading

I could contribute

Let's keep in touch, Chris! DATENUMERIC Thanks for calling me!

Hey Chris.......... 
I'm almost positive I approved of this deal and I didn't tell you. DATENUMERIC Do you 
have any comments to add? DATENUMERIC I'm going to forward this to Scott and Dick and 
ask them how they would like for me to handle this. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Do not share any of 
this with CES. DATENUMERIC Thanks. 
Possible penalty for Saturday's gas is below.

CDC could invoke DECNUMERIC per dth penalty plus the tariff cost. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I will not know 
they will invoke this until after they close the month.

What are the penalties for Saturday? 
Marianne Stiles 
Over the weekend we requested DATENUMERIC dth additional (just rolled the deal from 
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC However, Enron 
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC They only did it for 
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC When I ran my 
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I called Joann 
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and 
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I 
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I ran 
my TCO reports and it was not on there. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler) 
to find out why. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I 
called stating the weekend was missing. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC She said she was told the deal was 
only for two days (27th and 28th). DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I told her that was incorrect as it was 
through the entire weekend. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC However, she did agree to put in the noms for 
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this 
morning to negotiate price. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I told her the price would have calculated last 
To make a long story short, DATENUMERIC we were cut DATENUMERIC dth going to CKY on the 29th 
(during and OFO/OMO). DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Any penalties should be passed along to Enron. 
expect a call from Chris this morning.

on it. DATENUMERIC Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North America 
now has DATENUMERIC storage contracts. 
Brenda H Fletcher 
Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES DATENUMERIC Cove Point as the 
counterparty DATENUMERIC instead of Cove Point for the January payment. 
The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the 
counterparty.

Because the burns significantly increased on DATENUMERIC from the forecasted amount 
Contract over-run is DECNUMERIC per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are DECNUMERIC per dkt. 
Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES 
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. 
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. 
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage 
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what 
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling 
FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any 
costs over the space that retail had DECNUMERIC for choice), Enron had the 
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES

Hey, I'm too tired to think so I started going thru my emails. DATENUMERIC Here is what 
your buddy wrote up and its not exactly correct. 
Here's my paraphrase of our meeting I sent to Vince and Vasant, VP's of 
Research. I hope it's basically accurate. 
Clayton Vernon 
Vince and Vasant: 
Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at 
the East Desk, related to gas transmission: 
Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example 
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay 
payment. Variable charges are DECNUMERIC for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and DECNUMERIC for 
overhead expenses. DATENUMERIC A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a 
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn 
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX INTNUMERIC DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The trader's spread is 
DECNUMERIC and variable costs of transmission are DECNUMERIC so the trader would 
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to DECNUMERIC for firm capacity tomorrow. 
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have 
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity. 
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum 
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of 
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet). DATENUMERIC For South Texas and 
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take 
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc). DATENUMERIC And, once the trade is in the 
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline, 
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts. 
copy of an email I sent 
Sorry it took so long. DATENUMERIC I believe this was the last email I sent out. 
Chris Germany 
Please wire DECNUMERIC to Enron Corp for the Elec settlement. 
Chris Germany 
And the anwser is??? 
Chris Germany 
Mark, David; 
Scott Neal wants to see what impact, if any, this will have on the East Desk 
P&L. DATENUMERIC I'm hoping we didn't show any of this as East Desk revenue. 
Earlier this year, ECT received a credit from Transco in the amount of 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron 
Louisiana's PVR replacement contract for DATENUMERIC and DATENUMERIC production months. 
ECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated 
with this contract. DATENUMERIC Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to 
corporate. DATENUMERIC The net effect to ECT is DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Enron Corp is also expecting 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in DATENUMERIC that was 
written off on DATENUMERIC (see below). DATENUMERIC The actual amount for the DATENUMERIC adjustment 
Enron Corp has had a DECNUMERIC receivable (from Transcanada) on their books 
since Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada. DATENUMERIC Enron Corp and Transcanada 
thought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT. 
In order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August 
month-end close, DATENUMERIC a wire or check made payable to Co.366 needs to be prepared 
by the end of this week. 
Please advise me the amount that needs to be made so that I can prepare a 
manual wire/check this week. DATENUMERIC I'll contact Inez Haberl regarding the payee's 
bank information. 
The offsetting dollar amount for the DATENUMERIC production adjustment 
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in 
sold. DATENUMERIC I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it. 
I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are 
going to make to Co.366 DECNUMERIC and the actual dollars in the system 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to 
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct. 
Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what 
the amount would be. DATENUMERIC Thanks, 
Melba A Bowen 
The DATENUMERIC production adjustment received from Transco was a reduction in 
DECNUMERIC Cash Out adjustment for a total credit from Transco of 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC ECT took this credit. DATENUMERIC This volume adjustment was entered in 
the sales system in DATENUMERIC reducing the sales volume to Enron Louisiana from 
dollar amount would be for the sales adjustment but someone in Client 
Services should be able to get this info. 
Chris Germany 
I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday. DATENUMERIC Tracy is expecting 
meeting plus a DECNUMERIC adjustment we processed DATENUMERIC in mid to late DATENUMERIC 
Melba told me this morning that DATENUMERIC the DECNUMERIC was for a DATENUMERIC production 
month adjustment. DATENUMERIC What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to 
Enron Louisiana's account, did we DECNUMERIC write it off, DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC pass it through to 
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or DECNUMERIC 
cut a check to Trans Canada? DATENUMERIC Who do I talk to about this? 
Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company DATENUMERIC 
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez. 
Next question, should we pass on the DECNUMERIC to Tracy or should we wait 
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00? DATENUMERIC I believe it depends on 
how long it will take to research the DECNUMERIC 
Comments, Questions? 
At the request of Melba Bowen the following meeting has been set: 
To discuss the handling of funds due Enron Louisiana as the result of 
reallocations on Transco. 
Date: DATENUMERIC Tuesday, August 3rd 
Time: DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC p.m.

CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas 
Eastern. DATENUMERIC CES gave Equitable INTNUMERIC dth in April DATENUMERIC and Equitable is 
giving CES the gas back in January DATENUMERIC in Tetco M2. DATENUMERIC According to my new 
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable DECNUMERIC /dth after the 
January transaction is complete. 
Here are my questions/comments; 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC David DATENUMERIC please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC The existing deal (deal DECNUMERIC is set up as a pipeline exchange. 
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC. 
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the 
new deal. DATENUMERIC Please let me know ASAP. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Linda/David DATENUMERIC do we have CES's contract with Equitable? DATENUMERIC I would like to 
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC David/Stephanie DATENUMERIC if the deal is structured the way Fred described it 
above, where do we put the DECNUMERIC fee at? 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Linda DATENUMERIC Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES 
deals. DATENUMERIC He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America. DATENUMERIC Who 
should he talk to about that??

I think we can change the ranks pretty easily. DATENUMERIC As far as the business party 
Ids go, I think we need to have you, Diane and the Transco rep (Bharati?) 
discuss what needs to come across in the proprietary file. DATENUMERIC Transco was 
making some changes on their side for the BUG stuff that we may not be taking 
advantage of. DATENUMERIC We will see how the CES stuff fits in there as well. 
Thanks, d.n. 
As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES 
contracts as well 
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union. DATENUMERIC Our proprietary file contacts the

than the DUNS number. DATENUMERIC Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's 
business party id. DATENUMERIC These 
are the valid business parties we use: 
Columbia Energy Services DATENUMERIC 
Columbia Energy Marketing DATENUMERIC 
As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various 
producers, we will 
need to include their business parties as well. DATENUMERIC For now, this is all we 
need. DATENUMERIC In the meantime, 
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert 
into Unify as do not 
Also, another continuing problem is the DATENUMERIC default ranking. DATENUMERIC We spend a 
great deal of time 
overriding this rank to DATENUMERIC as a default and use DATENUMERIC as the swing activity to 
be cut as we need 
it. DATENUMERIC Is there a way to default to DATENUMERIC so we only have to change the one swing 
activity to 899?? 
Thanks for you help.

contracts for INTNUMERIC Dthd each or a total of INTNUMERIC Dthd of peaking 
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system. 
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk 
Point electric generation facility. DATENUMERIC The variable transport cost on Cove Point 
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth. DATENUMERIC This gas was hedged by CES as baseload 
during the January INTNUMERIC but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite. 
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol. DATENUMERIC It was under the dresser in his bed room. 
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left. DATENUMERIC It is 
captured in a pistol storage case. DATENUMERIC I stuck it in behind the sheets and 
things. DATENUMERIC I saw Chad and Angela on my way out. DATENUMERIC They are a great couple. 
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work. DATENUMERIC I am going 
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he 
wants to lease Dad's pasture. 
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year. DATENUMERIC You had said we do not want to 
pay for a fence along the creek. DATENUMERIC When I have leased places in the past I 
have had to build new fence at my own expense. DATENUMERIC Most folk's base their 
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation. DATENUMERIC If I built fence 
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up, 
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment, 
excluding my labor. DATENUMERIC Something to think about. DATENUMERIC I hope we do not own that 
place for five more years. DATENUMERIC Gerald also said he would mow the grass around 
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up. 
Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead. DATENUMERIC They placed her in 
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation. DATENUMERIC I think she required about 
seven stitches in her head. DATENUMERIC There were x-rays taken and her lungs are 
pretty much gone. DATENUMERIC Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can 
read his prints. 
Stopped by and saw Bernie Max. DATENUMERIC Now where did they come up with a name like 
that? DATENUMERIC They removed the lymph glands from his neck. DATENUMERIC Starting down the torso 
just at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down the 
torso about six or seven inches. DATENUMERIC A triangle shape about the size of a piece 
of large pizza. DATENUMERIC The incision must have been about DATENUMERIC inches deep into 
his body. DATENUMERIC The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue. DATENUMERIC They took a pretty 
big chunk out of his chest. DATENUMERIC He had a six " x eight " piece of skin removed 
from his left thing for a skin graft. DATENUMERIC It looked pretty painful. DATENUMERIC He was in 
good spirits and bull corning around. 
I guess that is about it. DATENUMERIC I would like to have a timber appraisal performed 
on the Dad's place. DATENUMERIC I'll be chatting with you guys. DATENUMERIC Oh, I forgot the dang 
remote to the TV. DATENUMERIC I really was not for sure which one it was. DATENUMERIC I think I 
need it to program the darn thing. DATENUMERIC Keep your powder dry.

A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with 
buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game 
asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?" 
The man replied to the game warden, "No, sir. These are my pet fish." 
"Pet fish?!" the warden asked. 
"Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let 
swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their 
and I take em home." 
"That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!" 
The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here, 
show you. It really works." 
"O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now. 
The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited. 
After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said, 
"Well, What?" the man responded. 
"When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted. 
"Call who back?" The man asked. 
"The fish." replied the warden. 
"What fish?" The man asked.

Natural gas futures on the NYMEX closed higher yesterday as traders 
sought to cover their short positions due to a feeling that the market was 
oversold following the steep decline of the last several days. The June 
contract climbed 
was basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storage 
injection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce an 
addition to storage of about DATENUMERIC Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could spark 
a rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build. 
However, an injection of over DATENUMERIC Bcf could send the market to DECNUMERIC in a 
hurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose DATENUMERIC Bcf, and the five-year 
average injection is DATENUMERIC Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, the

Enron's Lay Calls for Open Access to Transmission Grid 
Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, says that generators should have easier 
access to the power grid. Lay spoke after receiving the US Energy 
Association's DATENUMERIC US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have open 
access to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the West 
if we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power grid 
throughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series of 
separate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also says 
FERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way that 
natural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested in 
energy infrastructure in the last DATENUMERIC to DATENUMERIC years, and it's going to take a 
few years to correct that.

Power Suppliers to Meet with California Governor 
Executives from energy suppliers are meeting with Californias governor 
today, and several are willing to discuss concessions that include price 
limits on power sold within the state. Last week the governor said he would 
seek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions of 
dollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigation 
into alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discuss 
limits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it is 
prepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through the 
summer of DATENUMERIC Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possible 
alternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiterate 
an earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at DECNUMERIC per MWh if the 
buyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy has 
proposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state in 
return for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices they 
charged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, and 
Williams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.

BULLS CAUTIOUS 
In spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiously 
bullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause 
with the prospects of hot summer weather looming."This is a weak market, but 
I think that below DECNUMERIC you have to anticipate the return of industrial 
demand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge 
off the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gone 
through a major change. Production has increased, storage DATENUMERIC is higher, and 
the injection last week at DATENUMERIC BCF was the largest since June of 1998,' says 
George Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. "I was skeptical of 
the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when you 
combine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balance 
becomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wild 
card is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. If 
prices fell to DECNUMERIC then that would be a reason to put on another DECNUMERIC 
hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chance 
prices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be an 
aggressive seller," he said.

California residents suffered through a second day of rolling blackouts 
yesterday as temperatures soared, driving demand ahead of supply. The

from the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has more 
than enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was running 
about INTNUMERIC MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projected 
blackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two 
500-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flow

next week. DATENUMERIC Leave Wed come back Friday. DATENUMERIC May not happen. 
Why doesn't Enron promote from within.... same old story. It just took a 
long time before EOL had the markets out there. 
I leave Tuesday evening. There is a dinner Monday night... you should get an 
invite... since Goodell has to do the family thing... as always. 
What happen to Dick?? 
Scott is your main man DATENUMERIC I guess. DATENUMERIC I don't know if he is going to keep 
doing it or if he's going to hire an analyst. DATENUMERIC I think Susan will be doing 
Texas Eastern. DATENUMERIC Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on 
Tuesday. DATENUMERIC I may be going Tues afternoon. 
When do you leave Houston? 
Vickey told me yesterday was her last day. I see Scott Neal is on Tenn Z0. 
There are no quotes out there... just for Enron's info. 
I'll be in town this weekend.. going to TCO/Gulf meeting Monday and 
Hope to see you. 
Hope your back and other aches are okay.

I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES. DATENUMERIC Maybe CES should 
just be you?? DATENUMERIC AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if 
he is aware of any items not in Sitara. DATENUMERIC But Ernie should have the whole CES 
picture nailed down. DATENUMERIC I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and 
we not be involved. DATENUMERIC I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email. 
Chris, how can Darla and Wade help? DATENUMERIC They work with me in Settlements???? 
Ernie's on the team now. 
Hi team. DATENUMERIC Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade 
behind NIMO. DATENUMERIC As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go 
away but its not working. DATENUMERIC So, DATENUMERIC this is what I need to know; 
Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above? 
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above? 
Chris, have you gotten anywhere with this? DATENUMERIC I really need to get this 
It is a CES deal. DATENUMERIC I have some support that Cindy faxed me. DATENUMERIC What is your fax 
number and I'll send it to you. 
Thanks for your help 
I just left Cingy a message DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance 
trades that we intiated. DATENUMERIC However, it could have been done by CES or EES. DATENUMERIC I 
asked her to call me back. 
Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved. DATENUMERIC John Bieltz 
is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this 
issue. DATENUMERIC She can be reached at DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Can you please get back to me 
as soon as possible as they would like to resolve. 
Laurie Ellis 
No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this. DATENUMERIC My contact at Amereda Hess 
(formerly Statoil) is John Bieltz. DATENUMERIC His number is DATENUMERIC and his email 
I'm sorry I have not responded sooner. DATENUMERIC Any new developement on this? DATENUMERIC To my 
knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades. DATENUMERIC Do you have a contact at 
Statoil? DATENUMERIC I can call and try to get more info. DATENUMERIC It could be some CES thing we 
were not aware of. 
Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG 
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000? DATENUMERIC Statoil has been very patient 
awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything. DATENUMERIC Gloria 
Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you. DATENUMERIC Thanks for your help.

This is what I want, at DATENUMERIC to DATENUMERIC footer with a DATENUMERIC HP motor. DATENUMERIC I prefer a 
shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing. 
Make it happen buddy DATENUMERIC and remember, I'm not made of money. 
I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k. DATENUMERIC How does the grass look up at 
Dad's. DATENUMERIC I am thinking we should maybe bale the hay. DATENUMERIC I have intentions of 
going up there this coming weekend. DATENUMERIC You should have bought a boat during 
the boat show. DATENUMERIC I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him 
about a boat. DATENUMERIC Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat? DATENUMERIC Freshwater or 
Saltwater. DATENUMERIC I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha. DATENUMERIC A friend of mine 
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston 
Whaler. DATENUMERIC I think the boat was around DATENUMERIC '. DATENUMERIC The sides were approximately 
behind that which served as a seat. DATENUMERIC It also had what I call a jack plate on 
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom. DATENUMERIC He 
could run in about 8" of h2o. DATENUMERIC If I remember correctly it was a V DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC 
horse Yamaha. DATENUMERIC That baby would fly. DATENUMERIC They are bay boats but Aubrey took his 
out in the Gulf frequently. DATENUMERIC You should call Duane Davis. DATENUMERIC I bet he can find 
you exactly what you want.

See what you can find me. 
I'm tired of my Ford Explorer. DATENUMERIC However, I checked new car prices on the

According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show 
below. DATENUMERIC We have DATENUMERIC options on serving this deal: 
DECNUMERIC buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone 
DECNUMERIC use Transco Zone DATENUMERIC wellhead 
DECNUMERIC buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St DATENUMERIC 
Most of the time we use option DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after 
paying the transport cost. DATENUMERIC However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the 
prices listed below. DATENUMERIC For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone 
SL IF INTNUMERIC DECNUMERIC and shipped it to Mamou. DATENUMERIC The total transport cost DATENUMERIC is DECNUMERIC 
(including demand DATENUMERIC this changes each month). DATENUMERIC We don't arb the supply with 
Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this 
is a term firm sale to NYPA. 
Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid 
price DATENUMERIC and the transport expense?

Re: Offers for Permanent Relinquishment of Firm Capacity in 
Conjunction with the Momentum Expansion Project 
As a part of the Momentum Expansion Project ("Momentum"), 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation ("Transco") is 
soliciting offers for the permanent relinquishment of firm 
transportation capacity on the Transco system from Station DATENUMERIC in 
Zone DATENUMERIC or mainline receipt points in Zone DATENUMERIC to delivery points 
in Zone DATENUMERIC or Zone DATENUMERIC at or upstream of Station DATENUMERIC Subject to 
certain conditions, Transco intends to combine such relinquished 
capacity with newly constructed capacity in order to render 
service under Momentum. Offers for capacity relinquishment may 
be made only for existing transportation services provided under 
Part 284(G) of the FERC's regulations. 
Valid offers must meet the following criteria: 
DATENUMERIC The capacity offered must result in a reduction of the 
facilities otherwise required to serve the subscribing 
shippers under Momentum; 
DATENUMERIC Inclusion of relinquished capacity in the project must result 
in a lower cost of service for the project than if additional 
facilities were constructed; 
DATENUMERIC The remaining contract term for the relinquished capacity must 
not extend beyond the 15-year primary contract term of the 
Momentum service agreements; 
DATENUMERIC Offers for permanent relinquishment will not be accepted from 
shippers who nominate for service under Momentum; 
DATENUMERIC Offers must identify the specific contract(s), MDQ, receipt 
and delivery point(s) in each contract at which delivery point 
entitlements (DPEs) will be reduced as a result of the 
relinquishment of firm capacity to those points. DATENUMERIC Shippers 
will not be permitted to relinquish a geographic portion of 
any contract; and 
DATENUMERIC Offers must be unconditional, binding and irrevocable. 
Such offers must be received by Transco no later than DATENUMERIC PM 
CST on Friday, March INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC After receipt of offers to 
relinquish capacity, Transco will finalize the design of the 
facilities to be constructed to render service under Momentum. 
Parties that submit offers to relinquish capacity will be 
notified as to whether the offer complied with the 
specifications set forth herein and whether the capacity will be 
accepted and utilized to render service under Momentum. DATENUMERIC If more 
capacity is offered than is needed under Momentum, preference 
will be given to those offers that reduce the cost of Momentum 
to the greatest degree. In the event of a tie, preference will 
next be given to those offers that have the shortest remaining 
term for the capacity relinquished. 
Shippers with relinquished capacity that is included in Momentum 
will retain all rights and responsibilities set forth in their 
Service Agreement(s), Rate Schedule FT and the General Terms and 
Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff until Momentum firm 
transportation service commences through the relinquished 
capacity. DATENUMERIC The relinquishing shipper's service agreements will 
be terminated or reduced effective on that day. Transco's 
acceptance of relinquished capacity is and will be subject to 
the following: 
DATENUMERIC Execution and delivery by the shipper to Transco of an 
agreement to permanently relinquish such firm transportation 
capacity (such agreement to be provided by Transco); 
DATENUMERIC Execution and delivery of an amendment to the shipper's firm 
transportation contract reflecting any modifications resulting 
from the relinquishment of a portion of the service related to 
such capacity, if applicable; 
DATENUMERIC Execution and delivery of firm service agreements by shippers 
subscribing to all capacity to be made available under 
DATENUMERIC Shippers relinquishing capacity will file in support of 
Transco's applications for a certificate of public convenience 
and necessity authorizing Momentum; 
DATENUMERIC Receipt of a FERC certificate authorizing the proposed 
Momentum facilities and service (including approval of 
shipper's capacity relinquishment) in a form acceptable to 
Transco in its sole opinion; and 
DATENUMERIC Placing the entire Momentum project into service. DATENUMERIC In the 
event that Momentum does not go forward for any reason, 
including, without limitation, the FERC authorizations being 
granted in a form unacceptable to Transco, the capacity 
relinquishment shall not be effectuated and all related 
agreements shall be null and void. 
Parties desiring more information regarding this announcement 
should contact Helen Laughlin at DATENUMERIC or Orlando

As you and I both know and discussed, New Power will manage what used to be 
the old CES TCo and Gulf capacity starting in April, DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC We have talked to 
the CDC's (COH, CPA, CMD, & CVA) have worked out the following with them: 
CMD and CVA will recall all of the CES capacity on Gulf and TCo from you. 
They will subsequently re-release it to New Power effective April INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC 
New Power will execute it at that time. DATENUMERIC This should happen late this week or 
early next week. 
CPA will not recall it form ENA and re-release to New Power. DATENUMERIC Can you 
permanently release all of that capacity at max rates to New Power as soon as 
possible effective April, 2001? 
For COH, the biggest pieces of capacity on TCo are FSS storage and 
corresponding SST contracts. DATENUMERIC They both expire in March DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Therefore 
nothing is required of ENA in terms of releasing them to New Power. 
There is a contract with an mdq of 1,000/day primary from Leach to COH DATENUMERIC 
Pittsburgh (K#: DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC that should be permanently released to New Power at 
max rates effective April, DATENUMERIC 
area. DATENUMERIC The primary delivery points are DATENUMERIC Parma, DATENUMERIC Sandusky, and DATENUMERIC 
Alliance. DATENUMERIC These contracts need to be permanently released to New Power at 
the following rates:

Chesapeake Energy stock being sorely undervalued 
By Melissa Davis 
Business Writer 
Ask the experts. Chesapeake Energy is more than a DECNUMERIC stock. 
Forget that Chesapeake is up more than DATENUMERIC percent from a year ago DATENUMERIC and up 
more than INTNUMERIC percent from its lowest days, not long ago, when it traded 
for less than DECNUMERIC Chesapeake still appears sorely undervalued. 
Last week, Chesapeake announced record fourth-quarter earnings that were 
INTNUMERIC percent higher than earnings for the same quarter in DATENUMERIC The company 
also reported a DATENUMERIC net income of DECNUMERIC a share DATENUMERIC which means you can buy 
Chesapeake for a price that is less than three times the company's earnings. 
"No stock trades for three times earnings," said Mickey Thompson, executive 
vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. "The 
independent producers are all undervalued right now. Chesapeake is just the 
most undervalued." 
Chesapeake is the 10th-largest independent producer of natural gas in the 
country. And natural gas, because of low supply and high demand, is one of 
the hottest commodities on the market. It's a huge money maker. 
So Chesapeake is in the right business at the right time DATENUMERIC and it's into it 
heavily. Natural gas accounts for almost DATENUMERIC percent of all the business that 
Chesapeake does. 
This has already caught the attention of some prominent investment experts. 
Chuck Clough has picked Chesapeake as one of his favorite companies in his 
current favorite sector DATENUMERIC natural gas. And Clough isn't just anybody. Until 
a year ago, he was chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. Shortly 
after he left, he established a hedge fund that returned DATENUMERIC percent, after 
fees and costs, during an 11-month time period when the rest of the market 
slid DATENUMERIC and the Nasdaq tumbled DATENUMERIC percent. 
Clough's young hedge fund now boasts DECNUMERIC million in assets. 
He's not too worried about falling natural gas prices. He's invested DATENUMERIC 
percent of his portfolio in energy stocks and most of that in natural gas. 
He's convinced that companies like Chesapeake will begin trading for much 
more than two or three times their earnings DATENUMERIC and soon. 
Stephen Smith, a Houston analyst for Dain Rauscher Wessels, considers 
Chesapeake to be a top performer among the energy companies he covers. He is 
convinced the stock is undervalued and that DATENUMERIC even after gaining DATENUMERIC percent 
last year DATENUMERIC Chesapeake will have another banner year in DATENUMERIC 
"Natural gas prices don't have to stay at DECNUMERIC DECNUMERIC DECNUMERIC or DECNUMERIC for them to have 
a good year," Smith said. "The prices could drop to DECNUMERIC or DECNUMERIC and that would 
still be a wonderful doubling of what they used to be. If we can continue to 
see DECNUMERIC gas prices, then I think that energy stocks DATENUMERIC and particularly 
Chesapeake DATENUMERIC will start to respond a bit more." 
Thompson, who moves within local energy circles, is very optimistic. 
"The natural gas prices we lived with for most of the '90s will never come 
back," he said. "I can see a scenario with DECNUMERIC and DECNUMERIC gas prices for a long, 
long time."

DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I want to pick the counterparty or leave it blank. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I want to be able to select one or more pipelines without choosing a desk.

Unless I'm missing something, it does not appear that there is a way for us 
to run a CPR report that shows all business done on a particular pipe 
regardless of desks. DATENUMERIC For example, if I want to see all business that is 
being done on Transco, I must run the report for both the Northeast desk and 
the Market East desk. DATENUMERIC This next weekend, the east is to be split into DATENUMERIC 
different desks, which will only complicate the issue even more. 
Russ Severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll into 
one position manager. DATENUMERIC Is there any way that we get something similar from 
the reporting environment. DATENUMERIC I'm thinking that the easiest way might be to 
have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk 
first when submitting a report. 
Please let me know your thoughts on this.

St. Mary's gas flows on Texas Gas [TGT]. 
On January 26th, TGT issued a Critical Notice, that in essence states that 
they will not accept a nom to flow gas if it doesn't meet certain pipeline 
spec criteria DATENUMERIC they will not accept gas over DATENUMERIC Btu content. DATENUMERIC St. Mary's 
gas is around DATENUMERIC Btu. DATENUMERIC Thus, this gas will have to be processed at the 
downstream Eunice Plant, or it will be shut in, starting either Monday the 
26th, or March 1st DATENUMERIC this is uncertain right now. DATENUMERIC I am working with Charlie 
Otto [Fred's group] and Jay Hartman/Brad Strong to put a processing contract 
together. DATENUMERIC Charlie has/or is working on a processing contract with Hunt 
[operator] and this contract will be pretty much the same as Hunt's 
processing contract. DATENUMERIC Since gas HAS TO be processed in order to flow, there 
is not much negotiating that will be done. 
Since the price of gas is high [and producers do not want to process] INTNUMERIC in 
the last couple months, there have been several pipelines to issue OFO's re 
Btu content. DATENUMERIC This is the first time that I know of that this has ever been 
such an issue. 
Terms of the processing contract: DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC fee, shrink/PVR will be about DECNUMERIC 
producer keeps DECNUMERIC of the NGL's. DATENUMERIC Per Charlie, he thinks that this DECNUMERIC 
shrink/100% liquids equates to a DECNUMERIC or DECNUMERIC loss. DATENUMERIC Thus, the cost of 
processing is expected to be around DECNUMERIC to DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC The processing contract 
will be month to month and used only when it is mandatory under the OFO. 
St. Mary's will be responsible for all fees, and shrink. DATENUMERIC As an example, if 
DATENUMERIC is flowing at the wellhead, and DATENUMERIC is VPP. DATENUMERIC then, there will be DATENUMERIC as 
VPP, DATENUMERIC as PVR/PTR [shrink], and DATENUMERIC as excess gas. 
St. Mary's would like the processing contract in ENA's name, since ENA should 
have title to the gas as it goes thru Eunice, and would just reimburse ENA 
for the DATENUMERIC cent fee, or any other actual applicable fees. DATENUMERIC Teresa DATENUMERIC can you 
put something together re this reimbursement. DATENUMERIC Charlie sees no problem in 
putting this in ENA's name, if someone sees an issue with this, please let me 
George, Melissa, Lia DATENUMERIC we will need to start nom'ing PVR/PTR. 
Chris Germany DATENUMERIC do we need a PTR contract on TGT? 
Teresa DATENUMERIC per the Production & Delivery Agrmt, it states that St. Mary's 
cannot process their gas. DATENUMERIC We will need a waiver to this section INTNUMERIC for the 
time period that processing is mandatory. 
Lia, George, John DATENUMERIC the OFO notice came out on January INTNUMERIC and I heard about 
this via Charlie today, is there some way in the future we can be notified 
more quickly about possible issues re the flow of any of our VPP gas? 
Charlie will get his first draft of the contract on Friday and will work with 
myself and Jay/Brad to get this put together on Friday, in case this OFO does 
go into effect on Monday. 
Anyone with any questions or concerns, please contact me immediately.

First, let me start by saying I miss seeing your happy face every day!! Now,

Juniper Energy is one of the producers we are marketing consultants for. DATENUMERIC I 
have the pleasure of preparing their invoices for them every months on the 
EI57 meter that is nominated on Transco, Zn3WH (ticket DECNUMERIC 
The agreed upon purchase price from Enron is Transco Sta DATENUMERIC less transport 
and fuel. DATENUMERIC In the past months, we have nominated this gas on one of our IT 
contracts and the transport fee reflects the max IT rate of DATENUMERIC plus DECNUMERIC 
fuel. DATENUMERIC That is what I subtract as a fee from the Gas Daily price to reflect 
what Enron owes Juniper for purchasing the gas... 
In January, from the 13th DATENUMERIC 16th, we nominated 2009/day from EI57 and 
transported it on IT contract DATENUMERIC for delivery to Midcoast Marketing, Inc. 
This path incurred a higher fee than the other two paths that were nominated 
either to our pool or to Mamou. 
The Ethel Midla delivery fees included: 
GP DATENUMERIC (great plains surcharge ??) 
The pool and Mamou delivery fees only included: 
My question is....are any of the Ethel Midla fees passed on to the delivery 
counterparty, Midcoast Marketing, Inc. ?

when you shave under yore arms, 
well, I'm in hawg heaven 
and awed by yore charms. 
Still them fellers at work, 
they all want to know, 
what I did to deserve 
such a purdy, young doe. 
Like a good roll of duct tape 
yo're there fer yore man, 
to patch up life's troubles 
and fix what you can. 
Yo're as cute as a junebug 
a-buzzin' overhead. 
You ain't mean like those far ants 
I found in my bed. 
Cut from the best cloth 
like a plaid flannel shirt, 
you spark up my life 
more than a fresh load of dirt. 
When you hold me real tight 
like a padded gunrack, 
my life is complete. 
Ain't nuttin' I lack. 
Yore complexion, it's perfection, 
like the best vinyl sidin' 
despite all the years, 
yore age, it keeps hidin'. 
Me &quot;n&quot; you's like a moon pie 
with a RC cold drank,

they git it at Wal-Mart, 
it's romantic that way. 
Some men git roses

from the cooler at Krogers, 
that's impressive, I say. 
Some men buy fine diamonds 
from a flea market booth. 
&quot;Diamonds are forever&quot;, 
they explain, suave and couth. 
But for this man, honey, 
these won't do. 
Cause yo're too special, 
you sweet thang you. 
I got you a gift, 
without taste nor odor, 
more useful than diamonds....

I met with Jeff Kiester of DTI yesterday regarding the storage offering they 
have on the market. DATENUMERIC They have DATENUMERIC Bcf storage capacity and 30,000dt/d of 
FT-GSS up for bid by DATENUMERIC However there will be up to an additional DATENUMERIC 
Bcf of storage capcity available before DATENUMERIC depending on additional 
turnback. DATENUMERIC All of this capacity is utility turnback mainly, East Ohio, 
National Fuel and RG&E. 
Potential uses for DTI storage: 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Desk use DATENUMERIC If we buy the storage without the transportation we would 
inject and withdraw at SP. DATENUMERIC If we do submit a bid, I would recommend that we 
try to incorporate free intramonth injection capability, effectivly giving us 
a no-notice type service that we could use to take physical positions in the 
cash market. DATENUMERIC The current park/loan rate is DECNUMERIC /dt/d, it seems we utilize 
this DATENUMERIC times a month. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC VNG DATENUMERIC AGL could want to look into adding storage to the VNG portfolio, 
the drawback is that the PL1 line has no excess deliverability, VNG's need is 
more a peak day issue. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Partner with EES DATENUMERIC Paul Tate from EES also sat in on our meeting, he 
expressed an interest in looking into potential partnering oppourtunities 
with the East desk regarding markets on TCO and DTI. DATENUMERIC This storage offering 
for example could be something we partner on. DATENUMERIC I plan to meet with Paul at 
the beggining of next week to discuss further (Dick I will check with you on 
your availability). 
Jeff also indicated there will be more transportation capacity turned back in 
the near future. DATENUMERIC There will be a posting for INTNUMERIC dt/d of Lebanon DATENUMERIC Leidy 
capacity coming out in the next few weeks. 
Market view on capacity release: 
With the utilities turning back transportation, the economics of the capacity 
release market will change. DATENUMERIC The utilities have historically released 
transportation in the summer months for DECNUMERIC or less (as low as DECNUMERIC in 
order to recover something from their asset. DATENUMERIC DTI will now be the marketer of 
the turned back capacity. DATENUMERIC Historically the pipeline has been very reluctant 
to sell capacity below max rate in the winter and less than DECNUMERIC DECNUMERIC at 
current rates) in the summer. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Jeff indicated that his view is that capacity 
values will increase slighly this summer and significantly next summer due to 
the new power gen load coming online DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC As part of DTI's last rate case 
settlement FT-GSS holders can no longer release transportation in the summer, 
that went into effect last summer-00. DATENUMERIC Although the capacity release market 
was a little tighter last summer it did not significantly drive up capacity 
release prices in the summer-00. DATENUMERIC My view is that two of the three power gen 
loads will be interuptible and therfore will not sigificantly increase the 
overall load factor of the system. DATENUMERIC The bottom line is that DTI is competing 
with capacity release and I feel there will be enough capacity release 
available on the market this summer to force DTI to sell it's capacity below 
DECNUMERIC of max rate. DATENUMERIC However capacity release prices may increase next year as 
more utilities turnback capacity and the new power generation may be in the 
capacity release market. 
Market View on Basis on CNG for Summer DATENUMERIC & Summer DATENUMERIC 
With the increased load and potentially low storage inventory level going 
into this summer, basis could be strong vs historical prices. However, with 
the inception of M&NEP delivering 400,000dt/d into the Northeast last year 
CNG basis (summer strip) was less than DECNUMERIC in Jan-00 and Feb-00, DATENUMERIC even 
though the April DATENUMERIC storage inventory level was the lowest since DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC In 
DATENUMERIC CNG Apr-Oct strip traded as high as high as DECNUMERIC in Feb-96 and dropped 
as low as DECNUMERIC by May-96. DATENUMERIC DTI summer load is averages DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Bcf, I 
don't think the 100,000dt/d load of the new power gen load will be 
significant this summer considering the additional supply coming in from 
Dracut. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC However with American National Power Inc (34,000Dth/d) and El Paso 
Gas Services Co (139,000dt/d) both coming online in INTNUMERIC that have 
contracted for around half of the Dracut supply, this may cause sumer basis 
prices to increase from current levels (Apr-01-Oct-01 strip DECNUMERIC this 
summer and depending on storage inventories 4/1/02, DATENUMERIC Apr-Oct-02 basis may be 
also get stronger.

RE: DATENUMERIC HIGH BTU LEVEL ON THE LAROSA LATERAL 
Tennessee is encountering high BTU levels on the Larosa Lateral. DATENUMERIC These high 
levels have been the subject of customer complaints that the delivered gas 
is interfering with the proper operation of various lines, regulators, 
meters and appliances located on the Larosa Lateral. DATENUMERIC Beginning, with the 
January DATENUMERIC Gas Day, Tennessee requests point operators of receipt meters 
located on the Larosa Lateral to tender to Tennessee gas that meets the gas 
quality specifications found in the General Terms and Conditions of the 
Tennessee Gas Tariff. 
The following is a list of receipt meters located on the Larosa Lateral: 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Red Fish Bay Transport 
Absent resolution of the problems, beginning with the January DATENUMERIC Gas Day, 
Tennessee will not accept nominations from meters on the Larosa Lateral 
tendering out of specification gas and will issue an Operational Flow Order 
Balancing Alert to the point operator.

Question: DATENUMERIC We received a tax bill from the Bienville Parish for gas in Koch 
storage for the DATENUMERIC tax year. DATENUMERIC I found out yesterday that ENA handles 
no-notice storage for NOPSI and it might be related to that. DATENUMERIC Do you know 
what Koch storage contracts we had for the DATENUMERIC tax year? 
We also received a bill for Sonat Bear Creek storage. DATENUMERIC I assume this would 
all be for CES/New Power. DATENUMERIC If you know of any other Sonat storages we had for 
the DATENUMERIC tax year, please let me know.

Could you please send the service agreement into Koch for the Ormet

negotiated with Koch. DATENUMERIC Koch has to post our deal for five days, so could you 
please try to send it out today if at all possible. DATENUMERIC I am also sending you 
the draft letter agreement that Koch sent to us which we will also need to 
execute. DATENUMERIC We will also need to put an IT agreement in place with Koch. DATENUMERIC They 
have offered the same discounted rates on an IT basis for any volumes above 
Also, could you please arrange to put in place an IT agreement on Cypress for 
delivery to Ormet Aluminum's Burnside,LA 
Thanks for your help. 
Craig Breslau 
Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypress. 
The transport rates that DATENUMERIC Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows: 
From Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis DATENUMERIC demand charge 
from Venice DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC demand charge 
from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch DATENUMERIC demand charge 
(if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a DATENUMERIC 
gathering fee on Mobile Bay) 
In addition we will be charged DATENUMERIC ACA from any of these receipt points. 
The fuel rate is DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC This will be passed on to Ormet. 
Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the 
same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis. DATENUMERIC If this IT is cut, we 
still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or 
on Cypress. DATENUMERIC Ormet pays all additional transport costs. 
Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly 
balancing at any point during the contract term. 
I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event 
that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the 
gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress). DATENUMERIC If you have any preferences 
for alternate delivery points, please let me know. 
As I mentioned, we DATENUMERIC have already quoted NYMEX INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC as the all-in delivered 
price to Ormet. 
Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is 
due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow). DATENUMERIC They are one 
hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated. 
Thank you for all of your help on this deal.

Re: DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC System Imbalance Notice 
Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive negative 
transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of receipts) on its 
system over the past several days. DATENUMERIC As of December INTNUMERIC INTNUMERIC Shippers 
are advised to avoid any additional negative imbalances as soon as 
Additionally, until further notice, Transco will institute more 
restrictive practices at its pooling points. DATENUMERIC Transco will reduce the DECNUMERIC 
tolerance currently allowed at its pooling points to DECNUMERIC or INTNUMERIC dts for 
Shippers with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the 
pools are less than receipts away from the pools). DATENUMERIC Shippers with 
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will continue to be held 
to the DECNUMERIC tolerance levels. DATENUMERIC Transco will not enforce these pool 
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however, 
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits identified 
above by the ID2 nomination cycle. DATENUMERIC Transco may proactively decrease 
markets to bring them in line with supplies at pooling points. 
Absent voluntary compliance with this notice, Transco may be required to 
use any remedies available, up to and including reliance upon Section DATENUMERIC 
of the General Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff, to

We cannot let you balance your mdq across the month but we can offer a low 
IT discount rate on top of the firm. DATENUMERIC (this equates back to the effective 
rate you were looking for. DATENUMERIC You can change the amount of firm higher if you 
like and then the ratio of IT at the cheap rate will also incease. DATENUMERIC Your 
cheap IT rate can be up to a volume of DECNUMERIC of your firm. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC After that it

DATENUMERIC matches the invoice so I think Deal DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC needs to be killed. 
The rate and volumes on Deal DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC match the invoice for contract DATENUMERIC 
but Deal DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC is set for this contract. 
Bottom line DATENUMERIC we have an extra deal DECNUMERIC in the system according to how 
we were invoiced. 
If you agree, please have Elizabeth kill the deal DATENUMERIC 
I just spoke with Jim Scabareti at AGL regarding the releases of capacity. 
AGL/VNG is fine with your proposal to release the assets for three years 
provided the releases are recallable for any reason. DATENUMERIC This recall right is 
consistent with our asset management agreement (which basically determines 
the nature of recall rights AGL has under our deal) 
Go ahead and release the assets, DECNUMERIC recallable, for three years.

Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for "Third 
Party" DATENUMERIC buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal DECNUMERIC and the deal we did 
on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power. DATENUMERIC Not a big deal for 
October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again 
for the winter months. DATENUMERIC I could see you guys buying incremental third party 
gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints. 
Example: DATENUMERIC You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your 
transport to get it to a citygate. DATENUMERIC ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel 
and sell it back to New Power at the citygate. DATENUMERIC We should let you know what 
the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on 
the worksheet.

Old CES deal 
Were you going to send me some deal numbers to check out for August ? 
think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this 
deal ticket. 
Let me know if there are any problems. 
This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month 
scheduling fee. DATENUMERIC We are still working on the East demand charges for New 
New Power Demand Charge 
Please send me the August invoice for CES. DATENUMERIC Did we do any manual billings for 
August? DATENUMERIC I need those too.

We do get invoiced by VGS. DATENUMERIC The Transport contract numbers are VGS01026-IT 
Brenda, VGS is all buy/sells for us. DATENUMERIC VGS delivers directly into Koch, CGULF 
and TETCO. DATENUMERIC We sell at the point or deliver into those DATENUMERIC pipes where we pick 
up on transport. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC FTS-2 and IT sounds like Columbia Gulf..Thanks 
Brenda H Fletcher 
Nothing is getting flashed on VGS for commodity. DATENUMERIC We are paying commodity 
charges on a FTS-2 and an IT contract. DATENUMERIC Can you get rates on the usage 
tickets for these contracts? 
FYI. DATENUMERIC Commonwealth Energy is adding a new meter to their existing contract. 
The meter number is DATENUMERIC and is at Hastings. DATENUMERIC This meter is gathering 
dry. DATENUMERIC This meter was a new meter set and will probably begin flowing at the 
end of October. DATENUMERIC It is estimated to produce about DATENUMERIC dths a day. DATENUMERIC Please

James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday. DATENUMERIC I 
don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either. 
He is going to educate us on the VNG contract DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC The demand charge and 
commodity is discounted effective DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This is what we know about the 
The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted DATENUMERIC commodity of DECNUMERIC and 
discounted demand of DECNUMERIC 
If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to DECNUMERIC 
What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for 
volumes over DATENUMERIC day. 
What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day DATENUMERIC for November DATENUMERIC

released capacity to Sithe (only DATENUMERIC dth per day), and acted as billing and

This year's Winter Operations Meetings have been expanded to include a

information. DATENUMERIC Transco will also be holding a pre-filing meeting in 
DC specifically to address the tariff changes associated with implementation 
of the 1Line system. DATENUMERIC That meeting will be held in mid-November and 
will be notified as to time and location in the near future. 
The meetings in Newark and Charlotte will start at DATENUMERIC a.m. and end at

I spoke with Rich yesterday. DATENUMERIC He said it would be OK to net the storage true 
up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice. DATENUMERIC I mailed the invoice via 
interoffice to Jeff. 
There are DATENUMERIC or DATENUMERIC deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably 
be billed to New Power. DATENUMERIC All of the deals in question are on the Central desk. 
How does the reconciliation look for Jan DATENUMERIC June? DATENUMERIC Rich said it was his 
understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal. 
Storage true up 
We can sell the tractor anytime as far as I'm concerned. DATENUMERIC We will have to pay 
some extra taxes but that's ok by me. DATENUMERIC The lawyer said we may have to buy a 
replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would loose.

A Service Verification is a statement created in the Settlements module of 
Unify. DATENUMERIC The Volume Management group uses this statement to approve a payment 
to a pipeline for a transportation related expense. DATENUMERIC The Service Verification 
shows an amount calculated on quantities for a contract in Path Manager, 
times a rate from DATENUMERIC either the Unify Tables or a rate on the Sitara deal 
ticket. DATENUMERIC I could put a zero rate on the Sitara deal ticket to zero the 
unnecessary expense out but this doesn't resolve the issue. DATENUMERIC Since we are 
noming agent only, we don't want something coming across the system for 
calculation of a payment. DATENUMERIC Is there a different way to handle these types of 
contracts when they are being entered in Path Manager? DATENUMERIC I've heard of 
something like a point nom as way to handle. DATENUMERIC Are we doing that on this

bulletin board last week.? This may mean significant DECNUMERIC for some of you.? In 
brief, we are filing a request to make an early partial refund.? The refund 
is related to the rate of return settlement in our last rate filing.? 
According to the rate case proceedings, the refund is not due until a final 
non-appealable order is issued, but we are requesting permission to do a 
partial refund sooner (around Oct 31).? As the bulletin states, if your 
company wishes to wait to receive its full refund after the final, 
non-appealable order, please notify me or another Transco rep. 
Happy Halloween.?? ii

Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to 
??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds 
In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a 
Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial 
Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion, 
Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the 
January INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to 
make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting 
Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return 
Issues on or about October INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC The refund is being made to 
parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set 
forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate 
the effects of current high natural gas prices on their 
customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed 
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to 
Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets. 
Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on 
or about October INTNUMERIC to Non-Contesting Parties related to the 
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to 
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the 
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC 
through February INTNUMERIC in excess of the amount that would have 
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the 
Commission's findings in its March INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC order in Docket No. 
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues, 
subject to the "refund floor". These interim partial refunds will 
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any 
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for 
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon 
If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim 
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final 
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital 
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds 
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non- 
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on 
or before October INTNUMERIC INTNUMERIC of its election not to participate in 
the interim partial refunds.

Chris DATENUMERIC this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some

Hello Chris, 
Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed 
about a week ago?(deal DECNUMERIC DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Well, the demand charges need to be in the

late payment. DATENUMERIC Please let me know if you need any more information.

RE: DATENUMERIC Iroquois' 7th Annual Customer Meeting, October INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC 
Just a reminder that TODAY, September INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC is the cut off date for 
hotel reservations at the Mystic Hilton for Iroquois' meeting. 
If you haven't done so already, you can make your reservations online 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC or with Hilton Worldwide at 1-800-HILTONS 
Use the group code "IGT" to get the Iroquois rate of DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC After today 
we cannot guarantee room or rate availability. 
Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about the the lack of rooms on 
Wednesday night at the Hilton. DATENUMERIC The golf was originally planned for 
Friday afternoon but we had to move it to early Thursday morning because 
of the holiday weekend, and could not get additional hotel rooms for 
Wednesday night because of another conference. DATENUMERIC There are still plenty 
of rooms left for Thursday night. 
If you are coming on Wednesday night, it is suggested that you make a 
reservation at one of the alternate hotels in the area and ask to be 
waitlisted for available rooms at the Hilton. DATENUMERIC The alternate hotels are 
listed on our website at 
four properties listed and the Residence Inn are less than a mile from 
the Hilton. 
While you're at it, if you haven't already RSVP'd for the meeting, 
please do so by September DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC You can register online at

causing some 
problems for these guys in settlements. DATENUMERIC Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I

Should this 
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this? DATENUMERIC I will be out of

Just an FYI update on the Iroquois DATENUMERIC parking issue. DATENUMERIC This might be 
redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on DATENUMERIC that we 
cycle of DATENUMERIC (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), & the cut 
volume was placed into PALS. DATENUMERIC As I understand it, the late notification was a 
us when they found out. DATENUMERIC Anyway, the DATENUMERIC MMBtu's are on the August 
Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn, 
incurring parking charges of DECNUMERIC for the month DECNUMERIC MMBtu's x DATENUMERIC days DECNUMERIC 
item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, & this 
parking charge is related, & so, may be disputable. DATENUMERIC Either way, the volume's 
currently not in Unify as parked, & will not show up on the Service 
Verification at present. 
Are there any updates to the status on this item? DATENUMERIC Thanks. 
Angie Zeman 
I got your message this morning, and I'm not ignoring you- I have just been 
extremely busy with bid week activities and cleaning for August. DATENUMERIC I think I 
know what you're talking about, and I handed that issue over to Chris Germany 
earlier this month. DATENUMERIC I have not followed up with it since then, and that is 
my fault. DATENUMERIC The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about 
the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely 
notification by any means. DATENUMERIC I think that Chris was looking into this issue 
with Colleen Sulllivan, because of the late notification. DATENUMERIC I will badger 
Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week 
after the dust has settled from the 1st. DATENUMERIC Thanks for understanding. DATENUMERIC -Angie

enter this in Sitara. DATENUMERIC I think she is back in the office next week. DATENUMERIC I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved. DATENUMERIC However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.

The attached file contains updated August FOM volumes for CES. DATENUMERIC This file is 
update to the one sent on DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The changes are listed on the 'Comment'

Doug Kinney 
Updated CES August FOM volumes 
The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 8/1and DATENUMERIC the 
following day(s) as listed DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC There are three DATENUMERIC worksheets labelled as 
'Total Reqs': DATENUMERIC Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each 
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM". 
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
a specific point. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until 
further notice. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC CES schedulers note: DATENUMERIC the attached file is archived on 
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate 
copy elsewhere on the network. 
'Daily Change' DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC shows the change (increase +/decrease DECNUMERIC in the daily volume 
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the 
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date. DATENUMERIC For 
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using 
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
fact effectuated). DATENUMERIC For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the 
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the 
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the 
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown. DATENUMERIC (e.g., If 
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional 
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.) DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This sheet 
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
take or turn back. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' 
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at 
pre-specified prices. DATENUMERIC Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or 
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated. 
'Comments': DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Contains comments on selected items on various days. 
Hans Herzog 
CES Daily for Aug'00 Requirements for DATENUMERIC and after 
Crystal confirmed that items coded as a demand charge on physical forward 
deals in the "External Column" do not show up in our P&L. 
Example: DATENUMERIC See deal INTNUMERIC sale to Reliant. DATENUMERIC I was concerned that we would 
double dip the reimbursements for transport demand charges if I show 
reimbursements on the transport sheet and we include the reimbursements on 
the Physical Forward sale as well.

With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more 
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we 
are buying. DATENUMERIC Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the 
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary. DATENUMERIC I would 
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the 
delivery points.

and delivery point on the contract. DATENUMERIC But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it 
and I am unable to verify the information myself. DATENUMERIC It could have a big impact 
on what we flow in Z6.

This has to be a retail contract that we are not using.

Beverly Beaty 
My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and 
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries. DATENUMERIC They are 
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them. DATENUMERIC The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery 
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among 
other things.

As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity 
contracts effective DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I don't think we should make any changes to 
the master contracts in our system until after the 1st. DATENUMERIC However, we will

Wade, I have decided that everything currently in our system is incorrect. 
Please set up a meeting with all the people shown above and we will discuss 
how to correctly handle this in our system. DATENUMERIC We also have some other supply 
behind the LDC that we might as well handle correctly. 
Wade, while we are at it, do you want us to look at NYSEG, CPA, and East 
Ohio??? Any others? 
People I need in attendance 
Mary Theresa or Jeanne 
Steve Gillespie 
Sylvia Campos (or someone from the contracts group) 
This is what I'm thinking, everyone please think about this before we meet. 
I think I will have Peoples set up as a pipeline and we will move all the 
deals to this new pipeline. 
Steve, get the Peoples password from Angie. DATENUMERIC I need you to go into escript 
(Angie can help you with this) and run anything you can get out of this 
system. DATENUMERIC These are actually CES passwords. DATENUMERIC It is my intention to use this 
information to set up transport or pooling contracts in Sitara. 
Phillips Production has/had two seperate PNG deals: 
To my knowledge, PNG does not send out production information to either the

invoice) from the company integrating the meter charts. DATENUMERIC I beleive that this

Wade, DATENUMERIC Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. But I need help 
understanding this one. DATENUMERIC We have a process already to handle John's behind 
the citygate deals 
Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia, DATENUMERIC we never nominate 
this gas nor do we see actuals. DATENUMERIC We hear about them from John and Terry and 
we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES. DATENUMERIC Whenever one of 
these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to 
account for these transactions internally. 
It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the 
citygate deals; DATENUMERIC that Terry puts it into Sitara for him. DATENUMERIC The offset also 
entered by Terry DATENUMERIC is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept. 
DECNUMERIC with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price. DATENUMERIC Angie 
schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual. 
Is that not the case here? DATENUMERIC Is this something that's getting reconciled in 
Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG??? 
By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade. DATENUMERIC THANKS! 
Please keep me abreast of the status.

already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them. DATENUMERIC The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery 
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among 
other things.

As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity 
contracts effective DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I don't think we should make any changes to 
the master contracts in our system until after the 1st. DATENUMERIC However, we will 
need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in 
Sitara. DATENUMERIC Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand

We sold directly to Clinton for the term of our deals. DATENUMERIC Clinton (Latrove) 
should have pulled directly from Power Gas Marketing's pool. DATENUMERIC The Power Gas 
Marketing supply deal ends Oct 31st and the local production deal ends Nov 
30th and then we will be out of the local production business. DATENUMERIC We've tried 
to tell everyone but I bet you still get phonecalls until we are out of it. 
Did we end up doing this deal or did you sell directly to Clinton? DATENUMERIC I'm 
thinking that you sold directly to Clinton.... DATENUMERIC Let me know. DATENUMERIC Thanks! DATENUMERIC md 
Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes DATENUMERIC 
it was right below all my notes on CanFibre. DATENUMERIC The customer is Latrove Steel. 
I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works. DATENUMERIC Does anyone object 
to that? DATENUMERIC I will wait until this afternoon before I call. 
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? DATENUMERIC If 
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. DATENUMERIC However, we 
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not. 
Questions that I have: 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. DATENUMERIC It 
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the 
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these 
types of noms.) DATENUMERIC This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas 
behind the gate and we don't need more production. DATENUMERIC If the customer can't 
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will 
only make my pool longer. 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest 
just a flat index price between ENA and EES. 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount 
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool? 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be 
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with 
DATENUMERIC ENA is responsible for purchases of DATENUMERIC MCFD DECNUMERIC DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company. DATENUMERIC This volume is will be decreased DATENUMERIC until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to DECNUMERIC of normal (Refer to attached schedule). DATENUMERIC There 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved. DATENUMERIC EES should have DATENUMERIC Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July DATENUMERIC 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume. 
Note: DATENUMERIC PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system. DATENUMERIC Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure. DATENUMERIC Their volumes have been reduced to DECNUMERIC of the original contractd 
Here is what I'm looking at for July DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around INTNUMERIC day. DATENUMERIC I don't know if that's dt or mcf. DATENUMERIC I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. DATENUMERIC This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls. DATENUMERIC For July, assuming the gathering fuel is DECNUMERIC and this 
customer pulls DATENUMERIC mcf from your production pool, you will get a DATENUMERIC mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. DATENUMERIC I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances. DATENUMERIC But, at a NYMX of DECNUMERIC that works 
out to DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC sounds good to me. DATENUMERIC Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. DATENUMERIC Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will. 
Marde said she would charge ENA a DECNUMERIC fee for all the volumes flowing. 
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. DATENUMERIC What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull DATENUMERIC mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July. DATENUMERIC It would be easy to see since that is the only deal. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. DATENUMERIC Comments DATENUMERIC Questions? 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool. DATENUMERIC Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool? 
If yes, how many meters?

Heidi (EES) 
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July. DATENUMERIC Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that. 
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. DATENUMERIC At what price will 
you take these deals? DATENUMERIC I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this. 
As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from INTNUMERIC per month to 
INTNUMERIC per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system. 
Phillips Production is also down.. 
For July, I would sell INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and DATENUMERIC MCFD x DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production. DATENUMERIC The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. DATENUMERIC It will cost 
DECNUMERIC per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. DATENUMERIC If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day). DATENUMERIC The Power Gas volumes go through October.

Thanks for pointing this out. DATENUMERIC To my knowledge we have never even tried to 
overlap the contract or do any segmenting. 
Any concerns to forward to Becky Cantrell by Friday the 11th of Aug.???? We 
contract DECNUMERIC an IT contract and a parking and loaning contract to handle 
our Canadian term supply. DATENUMERIC We typically transport to markets off Iroquois, to 
Tennnessee pipeline and CNG pipeline. DATENUMERIC That is a simplified summary of our 
daily activity on Iroquois. DATENUMERIC If you need any information, please let me 
As noted in the Order DATENUMERIC summary you received a couple of weeks ago, 
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented 
capacity. DATENUMERIC Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the 
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement 
shipper. DATENUMERIC Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not) 
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible. DATENUMERIC For instance, 
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the 
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy 
to complete within GISB timelines. 
Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on 
Iroquois' system? DATENUMERIC Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths? 
Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments 
on this issue. DATENUMERIC I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

I created deal DATENUMERIC (sale to EES). DATENUMERIC This deal should get matched with the 
purchase from Power Gas Marketing, deal DATENUMERIC for July and August. DATENUMERIC The deal 
volume is INTNUMERIC for the month. DATENUMERIC We have the Power Gas deal thru October. DATENUMERIC We 
still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone. 
I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is INTNUMERIC so I entered an 
expected volume of DATENUMERIC on the EES deal. DATENUMERIC I didn't want to mess anything up so 
close to nom time. DATENUMERIC Please put INTNUMERIC for the month on both deals for July. 
I changed the volume on deal DATENUMERIC to DATENUMERIC for the month. DATENUMERIC This volume 
fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume. DATENUMERIC This 
deal also goes through October. 
We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company. DATENUMERIC I did not 
see a deal in the system for August so I created INTNUMERIC the price needs to 
be corrected. DATENUMERIC This deal goes through November. DATENUMERIC The estimated volume for 
August is DATENUMERIC per day, this volume also fluctuates each month.. 
We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton, deal DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The price on

we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at

RE: Modifications to Capacity Release Processes and Segmentation 
and Order DATENUMERIC Compliance filings 
On June INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Transco made a compliance filing with the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in Docket No. RP00-17-000. 
This filing proposed several changes to the Capacity Release and 
capacity segmentation procedures that are to become effective for 
business beginning gas day September INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC A customer meeting 
will be held in Washington DC on August INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC at DATENUMERIC a.m. 
(please see the Transit posting dated July INTNUMERIC DECNUMERIC and in Houston 
on August DATENUMERIC INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC at the Williams Tower, Level INTNUMERIC Dining Room C 
at DATENUMERIC p.m. DATENUMERIC The Houston meeting will address both the segmentation 
changes and highlights of Transco's Order 637/637A Compliance filing, 
with segmentation being discussed from DATENUMERIC p.m. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC p.m. and the 
Order DATENUMERIC discussed from DATENUMERIC p.m. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC p.m. DATENUMERIC In order to finalize 
the appropriate arrangements for the meeting, Transco requests 
There are two key elements to the proposed changes 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Use of "Master" FT-R Commodity Contracts 
Transco will no longer use the "Master" Commodity Form of Service 
Agreement for reservation rate capacity releases. DATENUMERIC Historically, 
Transco has required capacity release shippers to execute two FT-R 
contracts upon their initial acquisition of released capacity: 
the FT-R Demand contract and the FT-R "Master" Commodity contract. 
With subsequent reservation rate releases, shippers were only 
required to execute new FT-R Demand contracts. DATENUMERIC Each FT-R Demand 
contract was specific to a capacity release deal and the FT-R 
"Master" Commodity contract was used for all nomination and 
commodity billing purposes. 
Effective with business for gas day September INTNUMERIC INTNUMERIC Transco will 
require shippers acquiring capacity through reservation rate 
capacity releases to execute and nominate transportation on each 
new FT-R Demand contract. DATENUMERIC This will require new activities to be 
created for each capacity release contract. DATENUMERIC For any capacity release 
deals that span the August DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC September DATENUMERIC period, nominations for 
gas day August INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC will be on the existing "Master" Commodity 
contract and nominations for gas day September INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC will be new 
transactions on the FT-R Demand contract. DATENUMERIC Additionally, all 
commodity billing will be done on the FT-R Demand contract. 
Transco will send a "Notice of Termination" to all FT-R "Master" 
Commodity contract holders identifying the contract that will 
terminate as well as a list of all of the FT-R Demand contracts 
that will continue to be effective in September. 
DATENUMERIC Limiting nominations within a segment 
Consistent with FERC's ruling in this docket and consistent with 
similar rulings on Tennessee and Texas Gas, Transco will limit the 
quantity of gas that can be scheduled DATENUMERIC IN ANY SEGMENT of the 
pipeline to the original firm contracted capacity. 
Transco will aggregate all nominations under an original FT 
contract and any related capacity release contracts 
(or subsequent re-releases) to ensure that the total scheduled 
quantity for the family of contracts is within the original 
contractual entitlement. DATENUMERIC If nominations for the family of 
contracts exceed the original entitlement, nominations using 
any secondary capacity rights will be considered as secondary 
nominations and subject to cut on a pro-rata basis. 
As stated above, Transco intends to implement these changes for gas 
day September INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC In the event systematic changes cannot be 
completed or the FERC directs Transco to modify its planned 
implementation, Transco will notify customers via TRANSIT of any 
business practice changes as well as the expected implementation 
If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact 
your Customer Services Representative or Scheduling Analyst.

from Phillips Production. DATENUMERIC That works out to about DATENUMERIC day.

for the month.

probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it, DATENUMERIC CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can. DATENUMERIC She knows escript pretty well. DATENUMERIC Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January. DATENUMERIC Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime. 
Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas.

Hi Paul and Chris, 
Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local 
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was DATENUMERIC 
dth/month. DATENUMERIC Did you guys do a deal for this gas too? DATENUMERIC He usually nominates it 
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it 
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th). DATENUMERIC I know Heidi 
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not 
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there 
I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I 
want to make sure that's what we need to do. DATENUMERIC Just give me the word and I will 
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the 
last month he'll need to talk to me about it. DATENUMERIC Thank you very much for the 
clarifications!

Congratulations on your purchase of CES Retail. DATENUMERIC Chris and I usually handle 
the capacity so we wanted to touch base with you before August business 
Are you keeping the CES entity for the month of August or switching to TNPC? 
If you don't switch for August, when do you expect the name change to occur? 
If you stay under the CES name, business should proceed as usual. DATENUMERIC If you 
switch, keep in mind: 
For the Columbia Choice programs, the utility is required to release to the 
party responsible for billing Choice customers. DATENUMERIC For July- Columbia Maryland, 
Columbia Virginia, and Columbia Ohio released space to CES then I would 
re-release the capacity to ENA for nomination purposes. DATENUMERIC This would refund 
the original shipper the demand charges, then ENA would receive the transport 
charges and bill CES direct. DATENUMERIC Do you have an entity for Columbia Gulf and 
Columbia Gas for this? DATENUMERIC If you do, please submit paperwork for ENA to have 
agency rights. DATENUMERIC If not, call Erin Scott at DATENUMERIC to set up your 
business party. 
For Atlanta Gas Light, said they will continue to release to ENA, unless told 
otherwise. DATENUMERIC Releases begin DATENUMERIC for August allocations.

Beavy and I changed the following deals for July and August. DATENUMERIC We took all the 
August activity to DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This is how these deals should be balanced 
I'll look at the economics in the morning. 
NFUL Parking Deal 
We do all the KO noms on Navigator via k#60094. DATENUMERIC CGAS does not bill us 
anything on this contract, KO does. DATENUMERIC KO somehow gets the information from 
CGAS. DATENUMERIC That's what confused me because I remember us sending in a fax nom. 
We don't even talk to KO anymore. DATENUMERIC I wish KO would reference the CGAS 
contract on the KO invoice. DATENUMERIC Maybe we could ask KO to do that. DATENUMERIC I had to chat 
with DATENUMERIC KO person and DATENUMERIC CGAS people to get all that information. 
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but why is the pipeline set up as CGAS 
and what exactly do you mean by doing the noms via CGAS? DATENUMERIC Does that mean that 
we turn the noms into CGAS who then gives them to KO? DATENUMERIC It's been a long time 
since I scheduled CGAS and KO, but I remember that when I had a KO nomination 
I use to fax KO a paper nom directly and we use to put everything into 
autonoms under the KO matrix and not the CGAS matrix. DATENUMERIC What makes this 
different? DATENUMERIC Just curious..... 
Chris Germany 
I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission 
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity. 
I created deal DATENUMERIC effective DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider. DATENUMERIC We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract. DATENUMERIC However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
According to KO, we have not paid our Feb DATENUMERIC May invoices. DATENUMERIC I set these 
charges up on deal DATENUMERIC as demand charges. DATENUMERIC The amount are small. 
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal DATENUMERIC 
Questions?? 
A payment test file was sent to the bank in error and, as a result, a deposit

Contract INTNUMERIC volume=1,000/day, start date DECNUMERIC 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts

Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans. DATENUMERIC I believe 
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal. 
Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now. DATENUMERIC It was not on my 
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese. DATENUMERIC Please email everyone with 
end date when you find out. DATENUMERIC Also, please find out who the releasing shipper 
and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Reminder, those forms must be faxed back to Equitrans TODAY to effect a 
August DATENUMERIC start date. 
EQT Pool 
I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet. DATENUMERIC I would like to discuss 
our options on handling the pool with Heidi, hopefully after the July 4th 
I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before. 
Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name. DATENUMERIC If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool. DATENUMERIC I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters. 
Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts? DATENUMERIC Power Gas

talk about that after the 4th. DATENUMERIC EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Hey Team. DATENUMERIC Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans 
market and we still have the production. DATENUMERIC For July, take all of this gas into 
CNG. DATENUMERIC You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara. DATENUMERIC You

I recommend that CES have ENA match the pricing for each package that has 
been bid. DATENUMERIC This means that we will let the unbid portion of capacity remain 
under the posting. 
Please copy me on your e-mail to ENA. DATENUMERIC Thanks 
This should do it. I believe the BGE Rate Schedule on CNG is GSS. Call if you 
need more info. 
I will have a discussion with Dick Jenkins on Tuesday afternoon. DATENUMERIC I will 
see what he can offer to us in terms of of bundled delivered package. DATENUMERIC ENA

anyway you can take a stab at what our position is from Nov DATENUMERIC to Oct DATENUMERIC by 
zone and op, less the winter storage and SST that we own? DATENUMERIC I need a good 
idea what our needs are. DATENUMERIC I could compile this myself but I am loaded up on 
finalizing the deal on Monday. DATENUMERIC Thanks 
Surprisingly, INTNUMERIC of our INTNUMERIC dth/d of capacity that TCO had put out

I changed the volume on deal DATENUMERIC from DATENUMERIC dth/day to DATENUMERIC dth/day. DATENUMERIC This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA. DATENUMERIC The price on this deal is NX1 INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC (per MCF). DATENUMERIC John, is this price 
adjusted for dth?? 
I created deal INTNUMERIC purchase from StatOil, volume of DATENUMERIC day, the price is

DATENUMERIC with the same counterparty. DATENUMERIC This deal should have been in the system

should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
I changed the volume on deal DATENUMERIC from DATENUMERIC dth to DATENUMERIC dth/day. DATENUMERIC This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.

Fuel knows how we will be billed yet so I am going to show this as a demand 
charge on contract A02353 until we figure it out.

We have a new Park & Loan DATENUMERIC Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
to our brand new firm storage contract. DATENUMERIC We are now long FSS and short PALS. 
We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to INTNUMERIC dth per day. 
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than INTNUMERIC dth 
on any given day. DATENUMERIC Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy. DATENUMERIC We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel. 
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts). DATENUMERIC We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish. DATENUMERIC We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS. DATENUMERIC And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it. 
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy. DATENUMERIC ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
and August. DATENUMERIC This deal is over on Aug 31st. DATENUMERIC I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet. DATENUMERIC I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara. DATENUMERIC I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first. DATENUMERIC I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet. DATENUMERIC All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the DECNUMERIC demand charge. DATENUMERIC Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal. DATENUMERIC If we payback INTNUMERIC dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a INTNUMERIC dth withdrawal on DATENUMERIC just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about DECNUMERIC

What happened to all my emails? DATENUMERIC How's my Duff? DATENUMERIC What's going on? 
Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes DATENUMERIC 
it was right below all my notes on CanFibre. DATENUMERIC The customer is Latrove Steel. 
I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works. DATENUMERIC Does anyone object 
to that? DATENUMERIC I will wait until this afternoon before I call. 
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? DATENUMERIC If 
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. DATENUMERIC However, we 
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not. 
Questions that I have: 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. DATENUMERIC It 
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the 
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these 
types of noms.) DATENUMERIC This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas 
behind the gate and we don't need more production. DATENUMERIC If the customer can't 
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will 
only make my pool longer. 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest 
just a flat index price between ENA and EES. 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount 
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool? 
DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be 
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with 
DATENUMERIC ENA is responsible for purchases of DATENUMERIC MCFD DECNUMERIC DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company. DATENUMERIC This volume is will be decreased DATENUMERIC until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to DECNUMERIC of normal (Refer to attached schedule). DATENUMERIC There 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved. DATENUMERIC EES should have DATENUMERIC Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July DATENUMERIC 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume. 
Note: DATENUMERIC PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system. DATENUMERIC Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure. DATENUMERIC Their volumes have been reduced to DECNUMERIC of the original contractd 
Here is what I'm looking at for July DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around INTNUMERIC day. DATENUMERIC I don't know if that's dt or mcf. DATENUMERIC I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. DATENUMERIC This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls. DATENUMERIC For July, assuming the gathering fuel is DECNUMERIC and this 
customer pulls DATENUMERIC mcf from your production pool, you will get a DATENUMERIC mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. DATENUMERIC I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances. DATENUMERIC But, at a NYMX of DECNUMERIC that works 
out to DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC sounds good to me. DATENUMERIC Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. DATENUMERIC Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will. 
Marde said she would charge ENA a DECNUMERIC fee for all the volumes flowing. 
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. DATENUMERIC What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull DATENUMERIC mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July. DATENUMERIC It would be easy to see since that is the only deal. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. DATENUMERIC Comments DATENUMERIC Questions? 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool. DATENUMERIC Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool? 
If yes, how many meters? 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples 
Phillips DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Power Gas Marketing 
Heidi (EES) 
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July. DATENUMERIC Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that. 
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. DATENUMERIC At what price will 
you take these deals? DATENUMERIC I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this. 
As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from INTNUMERIC per month to 
INTNUMERIC per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system. 
Phillips Production is also down.. 
For July, I would sell INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and DATENUMERIC MCFD x DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production. DATENUMERIC The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. DATENUMERIC It will cost 
DECNUMERIC per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. DATENUMERIC If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day). DATENUMERIC The Power Gas volumes go through October.

Transport Deal 
I'm not sure if it matters but it will make it easier to find, I think. 
Yes, the producer receives a fixed price, however, these deals are probably 
in TAGG as Nymex plus basis deals. DATENUMERIC Phillips deal was transferred to ENA, 
Power Gas was triggered on ENA books. 
Or does it matter??? 
So both of these suppliers are now fixed price because DATENUMERIC they locked in the

week. I would like to get this matter resolved this week. 
New Power Company 
We only took DECNUMERIC of what we could, so we can increase by Market Zone delivery, 
or not. We have advised any new buyer of the options and are keeping them 
informed if we are forced to make a move, as in the case of the INTNUMERIC of 
capacity on TCO. We are being conservative and keeping everyone informed. 
How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys 
looking at that adjustment? DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC OR, are you letting the buyer know this 
option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my 
Yes, we can adjust by DATENUMERIC If we add, must pay retro to DATENUMERIC and if 
may not get any DECNUMERIC back. 
Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct?

Here is what I'm looking at for July DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around INTNUMERIC day. DATENUMERIC I don't know if that's dt or mcf. DATENUMERIC I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. DATENUMERIC This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls. DATENUMERIC For July, assuming the gathering fuel is DECNUMERIC and this 
customer pulls DATENUMERIC mcf from your production pool, you will get a DATENUMERIC mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. DATENUMERIC I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances. DATENUMERIC But, at a NYMX of DECNUMERIC that works 
out to DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC sounds good to me. DATENUMERIC Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. DATENUMERIC Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will. 
Marde said she would charge ENA a DECNUMERIC fee for all the volumes flowing. 
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. DATENUMERIC What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull DATENUMERIC mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July. DATENUMERIC It would be easy to see since that is the only deal. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. DATENUMERIC Comments DATENUMERIC Questions? 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool. DATENUMERIC Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool? 
If yes, how many meters? 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples 
Phillips DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Power Gas Marketing 
Heidi (EES) 
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July. DATENUMERIC Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that. 
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. DATENUMERIC At what price will 
you take these deals? DATENUMERIC I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this. 
As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from INTNUMERIC per month to 
INTNUMERIC per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system. 
Phillips Production is also down.. 
For July, I would sell INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and DATENUMERIC MCFD x DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production. DATENUMERIC The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. DATENUMERIC It will cost 
DECNUMERIC per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. DATENUMERIC If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day). DATENUMERIC The Power Gas volumes go through October. 
Peoples 
How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys 
looking at that adjustment? DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC OR, are you letting the buyer know this option 
exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my guess)? 
Yes, we can adjust by DATENUMERIC If we add, must pay retro to DATENUMERIC and if reduce, 
may not get any DECNUMERIC back. 
Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct?

Trco Backhaul Rates 
The demand charges match what ENA was billed by the pipeline. 
Have you had a chance to look at this yet? DATENUMERIC It sound like NIMO is still 
willing to pay the fair amount, we just need to make sure that we actually 
bill them. DATENUMERIC Let me know how I can help. 
Can you take a look at the attached spreadsheet that NIMO has sent regarding 
demand charges due Enron and we have not billed. DATENUMERIC Kate and I are not sure if 
this has been billed correctly and wanted to verify with you. DATENUMERIC Please advise. 
Bruce asked me to e-mail our information to you. DATENUMERIC The following spreadsheet 
outlines the amounts we owe you for each production month. DATENUMERIC This shows you 
the exact charges we are to pay along with how much credit we are due in 
each production month. DATENUMERIC Each MARQ and FTNN charge on CNG Demand is credited 
on our monthly CNG Demand billing. DATENUMERIC This is showing us that you should have 
been billed this amount by CNG Transmission and then in turn you should 
bill us these amounts. 
(Embedded image moved to file: pic07770.pcx) 
If you need any backup in regards to these demand charges, please notify me 
by e-mail or you may call me at DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC These amounts are showing 
outstanding in our accounting statements, so therefore, I will be happy to 
assist you in any way I can to get these amounts paid. DATENUMERIC When billing, 
please fax me a copy of your complete bill and also mail an original in the 
mail. DATENUMERIC According to our contracts, we need an original invoice complete 
with wire instructions in order to make payment to your company.

There is a demand charge of DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC x DATENUMERIC on this deal ticket. DATENUMERIC I think the 
demand charge should be DECNUMERIC x INTNUMERIC x DECNUMERIC days on the month. DATENUMERIC This equals 
INTNUMERIC over the term of the deal. DATENUMERIC I changed the demand charge volume to 
Audrey, the global contract is DATENUMERIC and DATENUMERIC is the first month of 
this deal. DATENUMERIC We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge. 
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month. DATENUMERIC Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH? 
Chris Germany 
ENA has a put to COH (deal DECNUMERIC for up to INTNUMERIC dth/day. DATENUMERIC This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to DATENUMERIC for the whole month. DATENUMERIC I 
estimate we should make about DECNUMERIC on the deal change. 
Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put. DATENUMERIC I 
believe its in the deal correctly. 
Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

Joanie called Kara at CES about deal DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This is the CGAS citygate gas 
for Energy Express. DATENUMERIC We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to 
Energy Express. DATENUMERIC Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to 
change on this deal. 
Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport 
CES actually has. DATENUMERIC There should be some big changes in CES's transport 
numbers for June. DATENUMERIC (Ex DATENUMERIC ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract 
k#65403). DATENUMERIC Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS, 
we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet. DATENUMERIC Any credits 
we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES.

Hi team. DATENUMERIC Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please. DATENUMERIC May not be a 
problem but just in case. 
New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market 
customers. DATENUMERIC In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our 
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement. DATENUMERIC Below 
are the observations DATENUMERIC that I have. DATENUMERIC I would like to get you feedback on 
these. DATENUMERIC If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications. 
DECNUMERIC We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets. DATENUMERIC As such, we will 
only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" as 
applying to only those twelve markets. DATENUMERIC For other markets that we conduct 
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load 
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the 
agreement. DATENUMERIC In essence, we see the supply management agreement being 
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer. 
DECNUMERIC My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for 
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets. DATENUMERIC This would 
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL. DATENUMERIC In 
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH. DATENUMERIC It would also 
mass markets. DATENUMERIC It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the 
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase 
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC All 
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I 
agreements. 
DECNUMERIC We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity 
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I 
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control. DATENUMERIC I will need your 
viewpoint on this. DATENUMERIC If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity 
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our 
ability to market any excess capacity in open market. DATENUMERIC Bottom-line, I want to 
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for 
un-utilized capacity. 
DECNUMERIC I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause. 
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar 
nature and service level. (supply management) DATENUMERIC To the degree that New Power 
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only 
transactions would not be subject to this clause. 
I know you will need to review the contract. DATENUMERIC We have some time to discuss 
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next 
Friday, if at all possible. DATENUMERIC I can be reached at ext DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Thanks for your 
CES Supply Management Agreement

It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year. 
If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books 
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES 
DATENUMERIC Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC we will need to 
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has 
been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized 
Based on the production dates of deal# DATENUMERIC and DECNUMERIC as combine with 
the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 
'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use 
the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal DECNUMERIC should have been entered 
with the CES prefix. 
John, can you fill in the missing details? 
John, I took the volumes on deal DATENUMERIC to DATENUMERIC for the term of the deal 
starting June DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 
I changed the volume on deal DATENUMERIC from DATENUMERIC dth/day to DATENUMERIC dth/day. DATENUMERIC This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA. DATENUMERIC The price on this deal is NX1 INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC (per MCF). DATENUMERIC John, is this price 
adjusted for dth?? 
I created deal INTNUMERIC purchase from StatOil, volume of DATENUMERIC day, the price is 
NX1+ DECNUMERIC PER MCF. DATENUMERIC This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate. DATENUMERIC David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara. 
Cindy DATENUMERIC deal DATENUMERIC is a purchase from CES DATENUMERIC Statoil Energy. DATENUMERIC I set up deal

should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
I changed the volume on deal DATENUMERIC from DATENUMERIC dth to DATENUMERIC dth/day. DATENUMERIC This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.

Its good we didn't book anything because CES just sold a lot of their 
customers to another company. 
I definatley think we should book these volumes for all of your reasons below 
plus each month we don't seem to have a decent estimate until the 30th or 
Here is your problem in getting these booked. DATENUMERIC You can do what you want, but 
I still think we should book it. DATENUMERIC The flexibility in takes is only DECNUMERIC so 
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't 
book anything. DATENUMERIC Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell 
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to. DATENUMERIC In addition, per our 
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely 
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or 
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year. DATENUMERIC This 
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term. DATENUMERIC And finally, what if 
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in 
Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you 
I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are 
not reflected in the books. DATENUMERIC Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to 
book since there is flexibility in the takes. DATENUMERIC Also, he said he has a strong 
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it. DATENUMERIC Dick 
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now. DATENUMERIC So Chris 
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it. DATENUMERIC I'm sure I left 
someone out. 
This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June. DATENUMERIC This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday. 
East Ohio Gas on CNG 
INTNUMERIC dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing 
DATENUMERIC dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 
INTNUMERIC dth/day from StatOil 
INTNUMERIC dth/day from Questa DATENUMERIC Note: DATENUMERIC this is an estimated volume. DATENUMERIC We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so. 
Note: DATENUMERIC CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA. 
National Fuel 
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline. DATENUMERIC ENA 
nominates this gas. DATENUMERIC CES still has a citygate load of INTNUMERIC dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES. 
CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG. 
Local Production for June 
I changed the effective date on the following Transco deals in Sitara. 
Transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated 
Transco Contracts 
I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet. DATENUMERIC I am still 
billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 
The net impact is DECNUMERIC that needs to be credited back to CES. 
It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of DECNUMERIC twice. 
Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of DECNUMERIC 
equals DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we 
should DATENUMERIC issue a credit to CES of about DECNUMERIC DATENUMERIC Please redraft deal 
DATENUMERIC and let me know what the impact is. DATENUMERIC I would like to send out the 
credit either today or tomorrow. 
Trco Capacity 
In today's Gas Daily, Northern Natural Gas has a help wanted ad DATENUMERIC you 
probably aren't doing your job! 
Just be nice to me when you become my BOSS, Boss :o) 
Ohhhh....... DATENUMERIC Sorry- my bad........... DATENUMERIC I should never have doubted your 
superior intellect and experience........ DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Humbley, DATENUMERIC az 
I thought the meter numbers were different. 
If you'll notice, the DATENUMERIC postings were all the same..... DATENUMERIC :) DATENUMERIC I'll make sure 
to send this postings to all those listed below when they come upnext time.

APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE 
Dear West Virginia Producer, 
Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures. DATENUMERIC In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression 
into our gathering system may be approved. DATENUMERIC We have been able to grant a 
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make 
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers. 
For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: DATENUMERIC For a 
period of DATENUMERIC days, beginning DATENUMERIC Noon on May INTNUMERIC INTNUMERIC the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE 
compressor station. DATENUMERIC The Dominion "bubbles" affected are DATENUMERIC & DATENUMERIC 
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental 
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations. DATENUMERIC The incremental 
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the 
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors. 
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it 
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system. DATENUMERIC Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office. DATENUMERIC The application must indicate the 
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement. 
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing 
time frames. DATENUMERIC We will balance that consideration with our need to insure 
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights 
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited. DATENUMERIC In the event that more 
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for 
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Dear West Virginia Producer, 
Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and 
through innovative projects and joint ventures. DATENUMERIC In continuing with 
that process to bring you more value for your local production and to 
improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a 
process where compression into our gathering system may be approved. 
We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, 
and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to 
the producers. 
For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: 
the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept 
applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas 
feeding the Barbour County High Pressure System. DATENUMERIC The Dominion "bubble" 
affected is DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does 
exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements 
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
pipeline system. DATENUMERIC Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not 
unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed 
gas entering the system. DATENUMERIC Please submit your written application to 
Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office. 
The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the 
specific compression agreement. DATENUMERIC Dominion recognizes that the installation 
of compression requires differing time frames. DATENUMERIC We will balance that 
consideration with our need to insure that the application process is 
not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, 
the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed 
capacity will be forfeited. DATENUMERIC In the event that more requests for compression 
rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, 
Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis. 
Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression. 
Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under 
the compression agreement. DATENUMERIC Your name, company name and address,

There is a new virus going around, called "work." DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC If you receive any sort 
of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a

purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough 
of your crap... DATENUMERIC I'm off to the bar." DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Your brain should automatically 
forget the "work".

drag the "work" to your garbage can. DATENUMERIC Put on your hat and coat and skip to 
the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer DATENUMERIC (or rum
