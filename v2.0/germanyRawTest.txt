The STOCK MARKET closed sharply higher on Thursday following the 
release of today's report on retail sales for April, which was down. 
Today's report eased trader fears about rising interest rates 
however; it is unlikely that it will cause the Fed. to abandon its 
current policy of higher interest rates until there is further 
evidence of a slow-down in the US economy. Technically, today's 
action appears corrective in nature leaving the door open for 
sideways too lower prices on Friday. It will take closes above 
trendline resistance crossing near INTNUMERIC to temper the near-term 
bearish outlook in the Dow. 
JUNE BONDS closed higher on Thursday following today's release of 
friendly retail sales data. This week's rebound off the DECNUMERIC 
retracement level of this year's rally crossing at DATENUMERIC has allowed 
June to challenging initial trendline resistance crossing near DATENUMERIC 
Multiple closes above this resistance level would signal a minor low 
might be in place. 
CRB INDEX surged to new highs for the second day in a row confirming 
Wednesday's trading range breakout above DATENUMERIC Sharp gains in 
energies supported today's rally in the CRB, which has renewed its 
long-term uptrend. I would not be surprised to see the CRB trade 
sideways too lower on Friday as it consolidates some of this week's 
gains and possibly retest broken resistance at DATENUMERIC However, this 
week's move to new highs has opened the door for a possible test of 
weekly resistance at DATENUMERIC later this month. 
CURRENCIES the June Dollar closed higher on Thursday following 
Wednesday's late-session turnaround. The setback off last week's low 
as the appearance of a potential bull flag. Closes into new highs 
would confirm an upside breakout of weekly resistance at DECNUMERIC 
which would open the door for a possible test of the DATENUMERIC high at 
DATENUMERIC later this spring. The Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on 
Thursday with the D-mark gapping down and closing below long-term 
support at DATENUMERIC Closes below last week's lows in both markets are 
needed to renew this spring's declines. The June Japanese Yen posted 
a key reversal up after session lows fell short of the Feb. low at 
DATENUMERIC Additional gains on Friday would confirm today's reversal 
pattern however; June needs to close above DATENUMERIC to confirm a 
short-term bottom has likely been posted. 
PRECIOUS METALS closed mixed on Thursday. June gold posted a new low 
close for the week and in doing so turned a number of short-term 
momentum indicators bearish. Follow-through weakness on Friday could 
set the stage for a possible test of May's low at DATENUMERIC in the near 
future. July silver closed lower following Wednesday's inside day 
increasing the odds July will try and test this spring's double 
bottom at DATENUMERIC Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for 
sideways trading on Friday. July copper closed slightly higher on 
Thursday after probing last week's gap. Momentum indicators are 
overbought and turning bearish warning bulls, time is running out and 
downside risk is increasing. Closes below gap support at DATENUMERIC would 
confirm a short-term top has been posted. 
GRAINS closed higher on fund buying and NOAA weather forecast. July 
corn posted an inside day with a fractionally higher close as traders 
digested Wednesday's bullish long-range weather forecast from NOAA. 
Light consolidation ahead of Friday's supply/demand report also 
limited today's gains. NOAA is still calling for a potential drought 
this summer, as LaNina is likely to persist through August. A steady 
too higher close on Friday sets the stage a possible resumption of 
last week's rally next week if hot/dry weather returns to the 
Midwest. July wheat gapped up and closed sharply higher for the 
second day in a row due to strong fund related buying. Expectations 
for a friendly supply/demand report on Friday and bullish weather 
forecast have been the driving factors behind this week's rally. 
Today's close above minor resistance at DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC makes March's high 
at DATENUMERIC July's next target, then this winter's high at DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The 
rising ADX signals additional short-term gains are possible during 
SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed steady to lower due to consolidation ahead of 
Friday's supply/demand reports. July beans posted an inside day in 
relatively quiet trading ahead of tomorrow's reports. Never the less, 
this week's rally is turning a number of short-term momentum 
indicators neutral too bullish leaving July poised to renew this 
year's rally if the weather turns hot and dry next week. Closes above 
spiked to new highs before light profit taking tempered today's 
meager gain. Today's high-range close leaves July poised to extend 
this month's move to new highs if Friday's reports come in neutral to 
friendly. July bean oil closed lower on Thursday in narrow trading as 
the market remains poised to extend its decline off May's high should 
Friday's reports come in neutral to bearish. Today's bearish export 
sales report does not bode well for the longer-term outlook in bean 
oil. If the decline resumes, the DECNUMERIC retracement level of this 
spring's rally at DATENUMERIC is July's next target. 
LIVESTOCK closed lower on Thursday pressured by weaker cash and 
product prices. June hogs closed slightly lower but near session 
highs as the market attempted to consolidate recent losses amidst a 
sharp rebound in bellies. However, lower cash bids and additional 
long-liquidation limited to day's rebound as the market is 
consolidating above minor support at DATENUMERIC Momentum indicators 
remain bearish signaling further losses are possible later this 
month. June cattle closed into new lows for the week confirming 
Wednesday's trendline breakout. Today's close below April's low at 
DATENUMERIC sets the stage for a test of March's low at DATENUMERIC in the near 
future. Expectations for rising grain prices and declining boxed beef 
prices continues to weigh on prices. 
FOOD & FIBER closed mixed on Thursday. July coffee continues to drift 
sideways ahead of the May DATENUMERIC retention plan meeting. July sugar 
closed on spec. buying on ideas world surplus should continue to 
shrink due to lower production levels in Brazil and other sugar 
producing nations. Profit taking ahead of the close tempered today's 
gains. July needs to close above DATENUMERIC to renew this spring's rally. 
July cocoa gapped up and closed higher due to fund short covering. 
Today's high is challenging this spring's downtrend line crossing 
near DATENUMERIC Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to 
confirm a bottom and trend change. Momentum indicators are turning 
bullish signaling additional gains are possible. I would not be 
surprised to see an inside day on Friday as July consolidates some of 
today's gains. July cotton posted a potential key reversal down on 
Thursday after session highs fell short of testing the DECNUMERIC 
retracement level of this spring's decline at DATENUMERIC Today's 
mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. 
Bullish short-term weather forecast for West Texas and the southeast 
US will continue to underpin prices. Momentum indicators are bullish 
and suggest additional gains are possible. 
The ENERGY MARKETS closed higher on Thursday with July heating oil 
posting a new contract high today. July crude oil has retraced over 
DECNUMERIC of this spring's decline setting the stage for a possible test of 
March's high at DATENUMERIC later this spring.

I need to know WHY you all are still uncomfortable using the service p&l, at 
least for demand charges. DATENUMERIC Please advise. 
The main reason I am uncomfortable about using the service p&l is because 
Chris, Dan, and Judy are uncomfortable with it. DATENUMERIC As soon as they are happy 
with it, we are ready to use it. 
Why are you still not comfortable using the service p&l, at least for demand 
What system resources are you talking about? 
I think the reason that they haven't moved has been one of timing. DATENUMERIC Chris has 
not had time to pull them out of their spreadsheets and put them onto 
another. DATENUMERIC This, of course, has led to the obvious point that we are still not 
comfortable using the service P&L from unify. DATENUMERIC When Scott gets back next 
week, we will together with him and Dick to verify what needs to be moved and 
take care of it manually until system resources can handle it. 
Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market 
area pipes to the Market East p&l? DATENUMERIC If the only reason is that you're not 
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion. DATENUMERIC It seems to me that there are 
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee, 
Texas Eastern and Transco. DATENUMERIC For now, why don't we leave all the demand 
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the 
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East 
book: DATENUMERIC Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG, 
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel. 
Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to 
make sense to me. DATENUMERIC Please advise.

There is a demand charge of DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC x DATENUMERIC on this deal ticket. DATENUMERIC I think the 
demand charge should be DECNUMERIC x INTNUMERIC x DECNUMERIC days on the month. DATENUMERIC This equals 
INTNUMERIC over the term of the deal. DATENUMERIC I changed the demand charge volume to 
Audrey, the global contract is DATENUMERIC and DATENUMERIC is the first month of 
this deal. DATENUMERIC We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge. 
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month. DATENUMERIC Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH? 
Chris Germany 
ENA has a put to COH (deal DECNUMERIC for up to INTNUMERIC dth/day. DATENUMERIC This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to DATENUMERIC for the whole month. DATENUMERIC I 
estimate we should make about DECNUMERIC on the deal change. 
Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put. DATENUMERIC I 
believe its in the deal correctly. 
Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

I was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but I was having 
problems. DATENUMERIC I will try again tonight. DATENUMERIC It takes a long time for system at home 
to show a photo email. 
Done, please review the following zones. DATENUMERIC They are different from last 
month's pricing. 
TGT Zone DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC the biggest change 
And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline. 
I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up 
pricing to take care of it. 
Monthly Pricing 
To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had 
a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have 
misstated something, please let us know. 
There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum 
withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached 
spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know 
its different volume requirements. 
Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum 
Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ) DATENUMERIC based on Enron's SCQ. There is no 
Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO. 
TCO Injection Session and DECNUMERIC of SCQ; 
If you add these months up, the total Injection is DECNUMERIC Essentially, 
shippers have an extra DECNUMERIC that does not have to be used during the injection 
period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is 
DECNUMERIC and December through March is DECNUMERIC typically not done). 
For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April 
DECNUMERIC If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to 
catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the 
ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval 
(I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve 
overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus 
overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full. 
Some other basic rules; 
Shippers do not have to fill storage DECNUMERIC by October. 
Shippers cannot have more than DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC in storage by June 1st, unless 
overinjection is approved by TCO. 
Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same 
way it did in the Winter. Depending on the DECNUMERIC SCQ, this will determine the 
MDWQ. As of today, DECNUMERIC is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw DECNUMERIC 
Once Enron is between DECNUMERIC to DECNUMERIC then the MDWQ is DECNUMERIC but remember 
Enron's SST is only INTNUMERIC until October 1st... so other transport will need 
to be used to avoid overrun charges. 
Why do we care about all of this.... 
Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still 
uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for 
Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay 
below DECNUMERIC there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we 
will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for 
overinjections above DECNUMERIC 
TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far. 
April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems 
running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run 
the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these 
reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or 
overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a 
volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing 
penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is DECNUMERIC dkt. 
Please save this note for future reference.

Dear West Virginia Producer, 
Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures. DATENUMERIC In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into 
gathering system may be approved. DATENUMERIC We have been able to grant a limited 
of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity 
somewhat more widely available to the producers. 
For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: 
For a period of DATENUMERIC days, beginning DATENUMERIC Noon on May INTNUMERIC INTNUMERIC the Gathering 
and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, 
Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations. DATENUMERIC The Dominion "bubbles" 
for Yellow Creek station. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there 
does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations. DATENUMERIC The incremental capacity authorized through new compression 
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
compressors. DATENUMERIC Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications 
it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system. DATENUMERIC Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office. DATENUMERIC The application must indicate the 
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement. DATENUMERIC Dominion 
recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time 
We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the 
application 
process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once 
granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity 
will be forfeited. DATENUMERIC In the event that more requests for compression rights for 
incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will 
award the rights on a prorated basis. 
Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression. DATENUMERIC Also include 
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement. DATENUMERIC Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be 
included (please print or type). 
Forward this information to:

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests. DATENUMERIC You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC to notify you of those requests that have been approved. 
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after 
I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of 
your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this 
opportunity to add compression. DATENUMERIC You can contact Joe Thompson at

Hi gang. DATENUMERIC We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin. 
I believe we need DATENUMERIC pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore. DATENUMERIC The new Sea 
Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La 
curve to value everything else. DATENUMERIC Per my discussion with Christine, the 
following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone; 
Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions. 
Here is the thread on the Sea Robin Curve 
I think the best thing to do would be to create a separate zone for all of 
those ISRP meters. DATENUMERIC The traders typically take deals from ISRP to the Pool 
and incur transport. DATENUMERIC Therefore having two zone would more accurately 
represent what is actually happening. 
I am in London helping Brent Price with some audit work that he is doing. 
Imelda Frayre 
Well, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different 
than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility 
mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently. DATENUMERIC Currently, 
there are DATENUMERIC active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of 
ISRP. DATENUMERIC That would mean I would have to create DATENUMERIC alternative facility 
mappings. DATENUMERIC Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to 
their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone. 
However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities 
would have to change the zone on every single facility record. DATENUMERIC Plus, we 
would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we 
would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities 
made it's change. DATENUMERIC So, let me know what your thoughts are. DATENUMERIC What are you 
doing in London??? 
I am in London right now, and dont' have access to a phone. DATENUMERIC The only part of 
Sea robin that should be moved are the meters with a prefix of ISRP. DATENUMERIC I'm 
sorry if that wasn't clear. DATENUMERIC Please let me know if that will be a problem to 
Imelda Frayre 
David, Sea Robin Pool is a zone on the Sea Robin Pipeline (SEAR). DATENUMERIC The Sea 
Robin Pool zone includes many different meters some of which do have a prefix 
of ISRP. DATENUMERIC However, there are also other meters in that zone that have the 
following prefixes: LSRP, FSRP and PSRP. DATENUMERIC I mapped the entire zone to the new 
curves you sent us. DATENUMERIC Given your message it seems like things might not be 
peachy after all if you only wanted the ISRP meters mapped that way. DATENUMERIC Please 
call me as soon as you get a chance. 
Imelda Frayre 
I am not sure if Searobin ISRP is a meter level location or Zone level, but 
as long as only Sea Robin Pool ISRP locations are mapped to the new curve, 
then everything will be peachy. 
Dave DATENUMERIC they called me on this to see if it was a meter mapping or a zone 
mapping. DATENUMERIC I said zone..... 
KARIE HASTINGS 
Imelda and Karie, 
The East desk traders have asked me to set up a new curve for the Sear/Sea

Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES. DATENUMERIC Cora gave 
a description of the invoice below. DATENUMERIC Let me know what you think. 
The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from 
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of 
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title 
transfer fee. DATENUMERIC TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user 
customer. DATENUMERIC Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool 
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler DATENUMERIC they would not be charged the title transfer 
fee. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU 
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee. 
Consumers Energy 
Sorry about that. DATENUMERIC Gotta go to a meeting. DATENUMERIC Give Muffy a hug for me. 
Could you provide me with this rate again this month, please?

I'm about to set up DATENUMERIC contracts on Trco for May. DATENUMERIC There is no rush on 
setting these contracts up for Unify. 
I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts. DATENUMERIC I am entereing these fuel 
waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara. DATENUMERIC Do I need to enter them on 
the secondary capacity deal ticket? 
Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing 
from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region). DATENUMERIC Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?

do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then 
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a 
different service type (so as not to change historically). DATENUMERIC To my 
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was 
cleared with Connie Sutton. DATENUMERIC So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed. 
DECNUMERIC If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural. DATENUMERIC And, I would like this done for May DATENUMERIC noms in

a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter

Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it. DATENUMERIC I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a DECNUMERIC 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES. 
Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. DATENUMERIC Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one). DATENUMERIC Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. DATENUMERIC In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up. DATENUMERIC I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

Greetings from India. DATENUMERIC Just a brief update to let you all know what is 
happening. DATENUMERIC This week I finished a DATENUMERIC week teaching course on the Book of 
Romans, with DATENUMERIC students from one of the schools in Kodai. DATENUMERIC I think that is 
the most exciting thing I have ever done in my life. DATENUMERIC I asked the students 
one day who lead them to Christ. DATENUMERIC Everyone single one of them have been 
saved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing in 
their school over the last year. DATENUMERIC But what was even more exciting than that 
was the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family. DATENUMERIC All of the 
others were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family. 
That young man's name is Anifa. DATENUMERIC He came to Christ through one of the 
pograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown so 
much, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion to 
Christ. DATENUMERIC Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord. DATENUMERIC Anifa 
will honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole school 
knows that he is a man of prayer. DATENUMERIC Recently Anifa asked me if I would teach 
him how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go back 
and reach his people for Jesus. 
Until Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated, 
because I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won a 
single Muslim to Christ. DATENUMERIC Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because I 
have won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others. 
Please be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates, 
and a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler. 
They will be coming in June and July. DATENUMERIC We will be starting DATENUMERIC new Churches, 
and ministering in the schools. 
And please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that was 
started last summer by the team from Southwestern. 
I look forward to seeing you all this year. DATENUMERIC Angela and I are praying about 
God's direction for our future. DATENUMERIC Please pray with us that for God's guidance 
as we plan for our future together. DATENUMERIC God bless.

CES First-of-the-Month Requirements for May '00 
Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for 
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any 
commodity costs. Thanks JPP 
Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some 
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature 
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a DATENUMERIC 
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and 
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!! DATENUMERIC This has been approved 
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

(Intraday) DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC and DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC There are two worksheets: DATENUMERIC The one labelled with

is needed at a specific point. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The AGL volumes in this spreadsheet are not 
current and should be ignored. 
The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease DECNUMERIC in 
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value. DATENUMERIC For the current gas 
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's 
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then 
the change is computed with respect to the DATENUMERIC request for 3/28). DATENUMERIC For 
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using 
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days. DATENUMERIC (e.g., If today is 
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.) DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This sheet should be useful in

DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I'll let Kevin answer this one. DATENUMERIC ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit DATENUMERIC volumes and updated Exhibit DATENUMERIC volumes 
through March DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April. DATENUMERIC I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD DATENUMERIC DECNUMERIC 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price? DATENUMERIC Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this? 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC See attached worksheets. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I don't know all the information on the local production yet. DATENUMERIC The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit DATENUMERIC FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport). DATENUMERIC The attached April file has a Local Production tab. 
Molly Johnson is updating this information. DATENUMERIC After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan DATENUMERIC Mar. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes. DATENUMERIC For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity. DATENUMERIC This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up. DATENUMERIC The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa. 
Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly. 
Please look it over and let's talk. DATENUMERIC The items are not prioritized in any way. 
1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The same is true for delivery 
points into Michcon. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
the Exhibit DATENUMERIC increment applicable to Michcon? DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Exhibit DATENUMERIC specifies ANR ML-7 
as the price index for Michcon. 
2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April DATENUMERIC 
TCO INTNUMERIC TCO DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC However, because Exhibit DATENUMERIC contains projected volumes 
these two market areas in April INTNUMERIC CES had to purchase from and resell to 
Enron DECNUMERIC of the April volumes contained in Exhibit DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Exhibit DATENUMERIC contains 
projected volumes for both market areas thru October DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Are we required 
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
this? DATENUMERIC I refer you to Section DATENUMERIC of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency 
Agreement (p. DECNUMERIC as having some bearing on this issue. 
3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit DATENUMERIC off Iroquios into Central Hudson are 
incorrect. DATENUMERIC The INTNUMERIC Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume. DATENUMERIC Since 
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy 
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend 
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell" DATENUMERIC with Enron of the volumes in excess of the 
(erroneous) Exhibit DATENUMERIC volume. DATENUMERIC If you disagree, let's discuss. 
4-According to Exhibit INTNUMERIC CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO DATENUMERIC 
(O&R), DATENUMERIC TCO DATENUMERIC (West Ohio), TGP Zone DATENUMERIC (Boston Gas?), would you please 
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
for April at each of these points? DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC (I also need these numbers for January, 
February, and March.) 
5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced? 
6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas 
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for 
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)? 
There will undoubtedly be other questions. DATENUMERIC I will direct them to you as they

capacity each month. DATENUMERIC Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month. DATENUMERIC We 
have been using this capacity since Jan DATENUMERIC to serve the CES Zone DATENUMERIC markets.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC and DATENUMERIC the 
following day(s) as listed DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC There are three DATENUMERIC worksheets labelled as 
'Total Reqs': DATENUMERIC Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each 
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM". 
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
a specific point. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until 
further notice. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC CES schedulers note: DATENUMERIC the attached file is archived on 
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a 
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 
'Daily Change' DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC shows the change (increase +/decrease DECNUMERIC in the daily volume 
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the 
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date. DATENUMERIC For 
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using 
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
fact effectuated). DATENUMERIC For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the 
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the 
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the 
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown. DATENUMERIC (e.g., If 
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional 
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.) DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC This sheet 
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
take or turn back. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' 
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at 
pre-specified prices. DATENUMERIC Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or 
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated. 
'TCO Storage': DATENUMERIC Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage 
injection for the month. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet 
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the 
"Daily Change' worksheet. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.

Update of April DATENUMERIC FOM reqs 
Hey guys. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I have a ton of emails to plow thru with CES buy look what I 
found. DATENUMERIC The CES storage proxy schedule is at the bottom. 
Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items: 
INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month 
changes does appear to be an issue. DATENUMERIC Since the contract didn't spell out in 
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we 
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly 
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. DATENUMERIC I know Chris 
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not 
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. DATENUMERIC I will ask that he forward 
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. DATENUMERIC Let me know if 
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Local production DATENUMERIC unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms 
here. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Here is what is happening: DATENUMERIC Your people are nominating this 
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), 
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. DATENUMERIC That 
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC We are 
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between 
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual 
contract prices with the producers. DATENUMERIC So, this is one issue we will have to 
address as indemnification items. DATENUMERIC That's problem one. DATENUMERIC Problem two is that I 
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all 
the nominations. DATENUMERIC We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is 
what you want). DATENUMERIC For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the 
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from 
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly. DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I'll 
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Monthly invoices DATENUMERIC regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like 
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the 
pipeline invoices on to you. DATENUMERIC Maybe we should change this process to one 
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his 
confirmation and review of all the charges. DATENUMERIC This means you may see quite a 
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. DATENUMERIC Let us know what 
you would prefer. DATENUMERIC Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that 
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to 
your office yesterday, March DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Chris will get all remaining demand charge 
statements to your office by Wednesday, April INTNUMERIC and all corrections he is 
aware of as of this date by Friday, April DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC I apologize for the delay. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Swap confirmations DATENUMERIC I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a 
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on 
Monday. DATENUMERIC Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? DATENUMERIC If not, please 
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data. 
Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory 
I forgot the storage attachment DATENUMERIC 
Melissa Flewellyn 
Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our 
balance will be as of April INTNUMERIC DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC As always, if you have any questions, 
please let me know. DATENUMERIC I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for 
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron. 
Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to 
discuss. DATENUMERIC Below is a brief description of each. DATENUMERIC Please let me know how you 
think we could best deal with these DATENUMERIC whether it's via phone call or having an 
in-person meeting down in your office. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Pricing DATENUMERIC I left you a message about this last week. DATENUMERIC According to Chris 
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated. 
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using 
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Consistency DATENUMERIC During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some 
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to 
intra-month changes. DATENUMERIC I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing 
mechanism and then apply it consistently. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Local production DATENUMERIC Apparently there was local production that John Singer 
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not 
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. DATENUMERIC We need to discuss how to 
handle this production. 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Monthly invoices DATENUMERIC We still haven't seen the complete January DATENUMERIC 
invoice. DATENUMERIC As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over, 
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. DATENUMERIC Also, 
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested 
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received 
DATENUMERIC DATENUMERIC Swap confirmations DATENUMERIC For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place 
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not 
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. DATENUMERIC Rich Contos and I 
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we 
can't seem to find the right person over there. 
Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

storage clarification & issues 
This is a good time to bring this up. DATENUMERIC Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of DECNUMERIC from DATENUMERIC 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA. 
Which brings up DATENUMERIC important points; 
1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already) 
However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May. 
Comments/questions? 
Brenda H Fletcher 
This contract is on the ECT April spreadsheet under CES Wholesale. DATENUMERIC What is 
the relationship between ENA and Commonwealth Atlantic? 
(Who pays transport invoice? DATENUMERIC Any reimbursements?) 
CGAS contract DATENUMERIC 
My worked. DATENUMERIC How many times a week did you put down?

Hey guys. DATENUMERIC I'm cleaning up my emails and I don't know if this was ever 
Doug Kinney would be the first person to start with. 
My sources tell me this means NIMO will continue to assign CES CNG capacity 
unless CES can prove they have primary firm to NIMO. DATENUMERIC What I'm not sure of is 
will NIMO start assigning CES the upstream Tetco capacity. 
Scott, who at CES worked with NIMO on the capacity elections? 
Molly LaFuze 
Does this affect us? DATENUMERIC If so, how? DATENUMERIC Thanks Chris. 
I don't know if this will effect Enron or not DATENUMERIC I don't even know if Columbia 
Energy had any firm capacity off of CNG released through NIMO, but just in 
case, I though you might like to know about this. 
Sorry I am not much of a help here.

Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity
