SUBJECT:	Jan CES deal
DATE:	Fri, 7 Apr 2000 09:05:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.  The volume is 34,248
dts and the price is $2.22.
I did not Bill CES for this deal.  According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the
gas and we paid it back in January.  Tom said CES was going to pay us for
this.  Should I bill the Retail group for this?  It looks more like a
wholesale transaction.
Chris Germany
There is a sale to CES for a volume of 34,248 dts, deal 149430.  It has your
name on it.  My conterpart at CES does not recognize it.  According to Unify
the downstream k# is 94946.  If you did this deal, do you remember who you
did the deal with?

Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;
"Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".
If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Chris Germany
The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM
gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to
get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and
transmission contracts moved over.

On February 10, 1999, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549, granting CNG
Transmission's (CNGT's) request for reclassification of various transmission
lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission lines
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at
Dear Pool Operator:
CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires
that the "wet gas" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.
Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m.
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT
considering
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your
As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify
producers individually.
We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled
shut       down will not be until 2002.
If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to

flow into CNG.,
Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters.  This gas is a backhaul

Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2:  The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue.  Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.  I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.  I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.  Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

here.   Here is what is happening:  Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.  That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers.  So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations.  We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want).  For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.
4.  Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you.  Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges.  This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.  Let us know what
you would prefer.  Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29.  Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.  I apologize for the delay.
5.  Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday.  Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you?  If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.
Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
I forgot the storage attachment ...
Melissa Flewellyn
Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.
Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.
1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.
2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.
3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.
4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.
Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's

the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For

the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is

Will you have the same contract # and the same Pipeline under Market East
and East in the same month?  If so, this would mean 2 different Global Nos.
and that would create a problem downstream.  Please advise.
Chris Germany
Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco,
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.
All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same
contract under both desk.

DATE:	Tue, 28 Mar 2000 07:50:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco,
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.
All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same
contract under both desk.
Comments/questions?

This contract number appears twice on the Service List in Path Manager with
different deal numbers ( 151880 & 156569). Is this duplication in error and
should one be killed  ?  The rate schedule is FSS.  I couldn't find demand
expense for this contract on the invoice. Is this a pipeline error ?

Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the
supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.
I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.

Dick, I don't have this deal in my records as a sale to CES.  When you get

Chris, Deal # 153683, Please take a look at this and see if you can confirm
that this was Buy/Sell or incremental. CES or EES? I have a supply but no
market. Thanks
Victor Lamadrid
Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and
replace with this purchase.
Sandra Dial
Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please.

Hey Jennifer and Dale,
I checked with Scott Neal and Dick Jenkins and they're on board with having
all 4 trading locations available for our customers starting April on EOL (if
possible with you guys of course).  The 2 existing locations are CNG SABINE
NORTH POINT & CNG SABINE SOUTH POINT and the two new proposed locations will
be CNG TRANSMISSION TTT SOUTH POOL & CNG TRANSMISSION TTT NORTH POOL.   There
may be some confusion among our EOL customers with the similar names to these
points so we have to be careful how we differentiate the names of the 4
points.    The Enron trader responsible for the 2 new CNG Transmission
locations will be Scott Hendrickson.  The business systems director at CNG
Transmission who requested this of me is Iris King.  Her phone number is
onboard with having the locations available to trade on EOL as soon as
If I can provide any more info.to you, please let me know.   THANKS AGAIN IN
ADVANCE!!!!!!
From:  Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny
Thanks for the information. It is good to know people outside of the company
are wanting additional locations to trade on EOL.
Can you let me know which trader will be trading this location? Dale Neuner,
in our group, will coordinate adding these locations
for EOL trading.
Victor Lamadrid
Hey Jennifer,  How are you?
We had a meeting with CNG Transmission today.  They have rolled out a new
pooling service for their customers called CNG Transmission North pool and
CNG Transmission South pool.  It's different than CNG South Point and CNG
North Point.  These last two pertain to CNG Sabine Hub Services.  As they
have presented these new services to their customers, all of their customers
are inquiring as to whether or not EOL will be trading these two new
locations in the future.  These new services on CNG Transmission have the
benefit over CNG Sabine Hub Services pools of being free for the time being
(until October at least)....How do we go about adding these two new trading
locations on EOL.  Volumes can be transferred from CNG Sabine Hub Services
points over to CNG Transmission pools at no cost and we are actually starting
to set up our supplies and markets in this manner to save on pooling costs
for April.   I have a contact that you can talk to at CNG Transmission if you
would like.. Please let me know and thanks in advance!!!!

BODY:
I changed the volume on the deal to 15,324 dts.
Charlie, this is a deal Dick Jenkins did with John.  ENA is buying this gas
Let me know if you have questions.
This is the true amount that Enron is buying back from Allied.
By golly.... the 15,000 grossed up is 15,324. Chris, thinking you want the
15,324 on the ticket for the 5 days. John ... do you agree too?!?!  The deal
Joan Veselack
In case anyone cares.... did the SIT withdrawal nom's to Allied Plant on the
FTS idle capacity. Effective 3/24 to 3/29. This will better help match the
burns for Allied.
Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Joan Veselack
John, per voicemail. Reduced deliveries to Allied Plant by 90,000 or

SUBJECT:	Calp Payments
DATE:	Thu, 23 Mar 2000 22:19:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
Actually, my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year
round.  This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand
during the summer.  Depending on the relationship you would like to have with
the customer, I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and
the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport
(at least with the way things work in our systems).
It's not Enron's intention to have Calp fund the OPT 60 payment. Enron
would like for Calp to release the capacity in Enron's name during the
winter period, and this would send the bills directly to Enron and
eliminate funding by Calp and reimbursement of Enron to Calp. We can look
at this again next winter. I'm not sure why there was a delayed payment
once Calp gave Enron the bill a month ago. I'll ask Mark Feldman about wire
Thanks again for your patience.
The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have
January and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?
Roman and Paulette,
Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday
March 24th. As soon as Mark Feldman (Enron payment God) receives February's
bill, he can pay this one too.
Thank you for your patience during this transition.

overrun your FTS1 contract. The 1 dkt SIT can be made up from Enron's TCO
pool. Please verify that this is okay. I'll schedule it for 3/23 gas day.

1.  Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG.  At
today's prices we save:
At these prices, if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.1100, we
should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie
2.  Buy Waddington, get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie.  We save the

Unofficially, according to Transco, NYPA has 4 receipt points on their FT-NT
contract.  Transco gave me the receipt volumes in MCF's and I used a 1.035
Btu factor.  I can't
Point  Volume MCF  dts
Ada  7,401   7,660  (at the east end on the north LA lateral leg in TGT Zone
My numbers must be off a little somewhere because NYPA's MDQ is 30,840 dts,
grossed up for fuel of 7.62%, the receipt volume is 33,384 dts.  To my
knowledge, we have never used ADA (which I know nothing about) or Carthage.
Currently we are giving NYPA half their volume at Mamou (off TGT) and half at
Henry.  At the very least we should be able to switch these volumes around to
better suit our needs.
Please note, I have not mentioned any of this to Stacey at NYPA.  The only
information Stacey was able to provide was her delivered MDQ and her grossed
up receipt volume.  She relies on us to tell her how much gas she is getting
at each point.

sell the gas to CES on injections.
On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal

SUBJECT:	Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ
DATE:	Wed, 15 Mar 2000 07:03:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG
Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61.
The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell
I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport).
In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not.  Thanks.
Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES?  This could be a can of worms.
Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.
Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.
However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.
Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.
Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.
Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?
I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.
Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points,
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on

Effective 04/1/2000, Columbia Gas Transmission will be transferring certain

Navigator stating that there were certain meters that were going out of your

"Appalachian Meter Allocation".  The meters listed in this e-mail will now be
on Gatherco's gathering lines and are going to be subject to the $.25
gathering rate.  Per Dave Fusek at Gatherco, our final estimates for 04/2000
SHOULD reflect these meters that were changed from Columbia Gas Transmission

finished in time, but they are hoping to have everything complete by the time
they release our nominations.

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these

1.  The index premium of $.032 is correct.
2.  Kimat Singla entered this deal in the system and it shows Maureen Smith
as the ENA trader and Tim Ray as the EES trader.  You should ask one of those
1-  According to EES, the price on deal #116090 should be CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I
+0.014.  However, Sitara shows the price index is CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I +0.032.
Could you please verify which rate should I be using in billing EES?
2-  On deal #156406, I was told by Judy Barn that this is an internal
(financial) deal, therefore, it did not get downloaded into Settlement.
However, per Patricia Downey at EES, this is a financial deal that was turned
physical.  Would you please also confirm this wherether we should bill EES
for this deal or not?
Thank you in advance for your help.
Vivien:  I have spoken with the EES scheduler on two CNGP deals and on the
40,281 volume (Sabine 702US) - this is a term deal that has always been
IF+.014.  It appears that ENA has changed the adder.  Please check as to why
this rate has changed.
Also on the CNGP deal where we (EES) has 186,180 at 3.406 - this is a
financial deal that was turned physical.  You may need to check with a Chris
Germany on both of these deals.  ENA doesn't even have this 186,180 entered.
Let me know.

Chris Germany
CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the
January transaction is complete.
Here are my questions/comments;
1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.
2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment
3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?
4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES
deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who
should he talk to about that??
Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

the Cornwell space.  I think the South Webster goes with Tenn Z4.
Dick, other than CES, do you know what our CNG citygate positions are
starting April?

Personally, I think you should buy a F150 extended cab 4x4 with the 17"
wheels.  To heck with gas mileage when you look so cool.
I'm not wild about Dodge either only because it is a Chrysler product.  Kevin
is actually the one that mentioned that one.
I have mixed comments on Dodge's.  I think either of the other vehicles are
Hope your injury heals quickly.
Black w/tinted windows
Extended Cab
Power 'stuff'
I'm thinking about Ford F150, Chevy/GMC or Dodge Dakota.
I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class, lost my balance,
stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle.  Jerry was taking the class with
me.  He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot..  If I was sitting in
a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North, the bottom of my foot
was facing North East.
I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.  I didn't hear this but the
Dr. told them to take me to "a very quiet room".   He popped my foot back in
place and sent me to x-ray.  I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments
are probably all torn up.  I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow.  Right
now, I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support.
I think you should buy one of those 4 door short bed Nissan Pickup Trucks.
What are you looking for in a truck?
I just heard that rumor.  What happened?
I luv trucks.  I was injured on Sunday,  I use crutches now.

Chris--The attached spreadsheet contains our Daily volume requirements for 3/7
Columns--one labelled '9AM' and one labelled 'Intraday' which is an update of
the requirements reported in the 9AM column.   The two columns will be
identical in instances where no change has been made.   Where the two numbers
differ, the Intraday value is the latest requriement.  In some cases where
there is storage (i.e., COH Choice) , you will see negative values for the
'PRIMARY' requirement.  This represents a situation where gas is being
withdrawn from storage and sold at the pool, along with the first-of-the-month
baseload daily 'PRIMARY' volume.

I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to

details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am
looking for some of the following; contract #, RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not
sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you
please assist?
2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details
3. TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details.
4. TCO K#65403- believe it delivers 19,000+ to BGE, but need all detail.
6.  Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below
7.  TRANSCO Z5-Ex 1 shows 150 capacity, I have no details.
8.  TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA?
9.   Texas Gas Z-4 to DP&L- monthly also?
10. Did CES have any ColGulf capacity that was assigned?

I listed one of the CES issues down below.  The other issue I have is
pricing.  I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the

spent at least 2.5 hours on the phone with CES last Friday.
I talked with Hunter.  Kevin Rosetti is the man.  Chris, please bring up to
speed on how to handle CES.
Chris Germany
I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.
CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

Let's see.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say "let me
know if there is anything I can do to help" get those invoices out.
Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean "I
welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract
and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing
scenarios."
Jeff W Westover
Chris, lets meet next Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. (Conference Room EB-3745) to
discuss the status of the January 2000 invoice billing (sales & purchase).
There is still a substantial amount that is not showing up  in Unify.
Customer is paying Enron $28 million on Monday and we only have $11 million
in the system that is showing up. We sent Columbia a manual invoice for
February 18th.
Send me an e-mail back to confirm.
Thanks, Jeff

A few more questions --
What about for the Central Desk volumes?  Who is going to estimate those ??
Who is going to compare March noms with the booked volume on Exhibit ?
Who is going to physically be the one to enter the deals in Sitara / TAGG,
both for Central and East for the remaining term April 2000 through March
When will it go into the books ??
I discussed CES retail with Chris. He is going to work with Dick on
estimating a good retail volume to book.
We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.
Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.
If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please

KIM NOVSEK BIZIK
Hi.  Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st.  I had requested 145 dth per day on
Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler.  For some reason Chris
Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth.  PSNC
me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled.  I instructed PSNC to
contact Chris.  Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth
the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second.  I did this.
This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March
1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed.  I called my transco scheduler and
she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.
(impossible as capacity was released to Enron).  All I wanted was 145 dth per
day for March.  Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should
and did get scheduled?  Thank you.

I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.
CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the
Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian
Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron
experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team.
In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following:
? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters
? Create purchase deals in SITARA
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc.
? Review calc sheets
? Maintain purchase pricing
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co
Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the
commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very
important area.
Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current
workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during
this transition time.
Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!

Dear Producers and Shippers,
In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant
would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable,
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:
1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or,
2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and
processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system.
We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson

SUBJECT:	Updated Mar'00 Requirements Received at 11:25am from CES
DATE:	Tue, 29 Feb 2000 00:44:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
Latest and greatest.
Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day.  This would
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable
penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.
Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.
Doug- Based on these numbers David's w/d from IBSS would be zero, due to
the AGL DSR.
Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00.
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you
yesterday.  Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes),
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were
picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the
attached version.
Sorry for any confusion.

BODY:
One correction:  It is our understanding that we will nominate this contract
until March 2000, not until the fuel management responsibilities expire in
2002, unless we are successful in negotiating an extension of the ENA/CES
Retail alliance beyond March 2000.
To ensure everyone is on the same page. International Paper/Union Camp
contract expires with CES Retail to perform the Fuel Management Duties in
2002. Fred Lombardo has been handling the fuel management responsibilities
from Pittsburgh and will leave CES at the end of February. CES is outsourcing
these management responsibilities to Alliance Energy Services. CES has a term
supply contract with Enron for 6900 delivered to Union Camp and this expires
at the end of March 2000. CES is in agreement that Enron will continue to
nominate this gas until the end of March 2000.
The Contract signed between CES and Enron, states that ENA has the agency
rights for the International Paper Contract.
Enron's understanding is that Enron will continue to nominate this contract
until CES's fuel management responsibilities expire in 2002. Colleen and
Melissa, please ensure both companies are on the same page. Fred Lomabardo
and his boss, Don Deal, were going to outsource the nomination rights of this
contract to Alliance Energy. This is not allowed per the Contract language.
In addition, Union Camp does not want to sign the agency agreement required
by TCO, because it is vague. Enron needs this agreement signed so we can
nominate the gas under Enron's accounts on TCO. We need CES's help in getting
this matter resolved ASAP.

DATE:	Fri, 4 Feb 2000 04:20:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as
possible.  This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.
Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),
we need to focus on it being accurate.
Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.
Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling
CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10
Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one
day lag.  After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any
derived curves.
If you have any questions please let me know.

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.   However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.   They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.     When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.   I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.   I
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.   I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.   I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.    She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.   She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).   I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.   However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this

SUBJECT:	TCO STOW Overage - 1/24
DATE:	Fri, 28 Jan 2000 02:09:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
Just wanted to make sure you received this.
Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.
Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.
Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend.
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling
FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to
cause unnecessary pain.

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .
1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for
production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on
current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here!
2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.
3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.
4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made
effective 12/1999 production forward.
Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If
necessary, please forward to your teams.
Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.
Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

Hey, I'm too tired to think so I started going thru my emails.  Here is what
your buddy wrote up and its not exactly correct.
Here's my paraphrase of our meeting I sent to Vince and Vasant, VP's of
Research. I hope it's basically accurate.
Clayton Vernon
Vince and Vasant:
Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:
Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for
overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The trader's spread is
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

Mark, David;
Scott Neal wants to see what impact, if any, this will have on the East Desk
P&L.  I'm hoping we didn't show any of this as East Desk revenue.
Earlier this year, ECT received a credit from Transco in the amount of
$463,609.20.  This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron
Louisiana's PVR replacement contract for 9612 and 9701 production months.
ECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated
with this contract.  Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to
corporate.  The net effect to ECT is $0.00.  Enron Corp is also expecting
$127,000.00.  This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in 1997 that was
written off on 1998 (see below).  The actual amount for the 1997 adjustment
Enron Corp has had a $600,000.00 receivable (from Transcanada) on their books
since Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada.  Enron Corp and Transcanada
thought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT.
In order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August
month-end close,  a wire or check made payable to Co.366 needs to be prepared
by the end of this week.
Please advise me the amount that needs to be made so that I can prepare a
manual wire/check this week.  I'll contact Inez Haberl regarding the payee's
bank information.
The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in
sold.  I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it.
I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system
($498,824.82).  He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct.
Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what
the amount would be.  Thanks,
Melba A Bowen
The 9612 production adjustment received from Transco was a reduction in
($124,582.69) Cash Out adjustment for a total credit from Transco of
($127,317.68).  ECT took this credit.  This volume adjustment was entered in
the sales system in 10/97 reducing the sales volume to Enron Louisiana from
dollar amount would be for the sales adjustment but someone in Client
Services should be able to get this info.
Chris Germany
I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday.  Tracy is expecting
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed  in mid to late 1997.
Melba told me this morning that  the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production
month adjustment.  What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)  pass it through to
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3)
cut a check to Trans Canada?  Who do I talk to about this?
Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.
Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00?  I believe it depends on
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.
Comments, Questions?
At the request of Melba Bowen the following meeting has been set:
To discuss the handling of funds due Enron Louisiana as the result of
reallocations on Transco.
Date:  Tuesday, August 3rd
Time:  3 p.m.
If you have a scheduling conflict , you can reach me at X36890.  If you have

CES gave us had at least twice as much volume on both of those tickets.  Do
they have the right to swing like that?

and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.
Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with
the end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing
shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Brenda H Fletcher
FYI - You may already be aware of this but I'm passing this on in case you
didn't know this.
Storage deals require a meter on both the injection side and the withdrawal
side in order to bridge - even if there is only a demand charge.
A zone is not enough, it must have a meter.  Let me know if that works.
The deal was entered on friday 1/7,  and your right it never bridged over to
Unify.  I don't understand the location question,
the deal was set up like all other storage tickets.  I'm just trying to get
the demand to download so VM can draft it.

purchase from CES for the storage gas.  Of course it will get much more

DATE:	Tue, 4 Jan 2000 11:33:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the
January transaction is complete.
Here are my questions/comments;
1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.
2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment
3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?
4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES
deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who
should he talk to about that??
Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

I think we can change the ranks pretty easily.  As far as the business party
Ids go, I think we need to have you, Diane and the Transco rep (Bharati?)
discuss what needs to come across in the proprietary file.  Transco was
making some changes on their side for the BUG stuff that we may not be taking
advantage of.  We will see how the CES stuff fits in there as well.
Thanks, d.n.
As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union.  Our proprietary file contacts the

than the DUNS number.  Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's
business party id.  These
are the valid business parties we use:
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772
As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well.  For now, this is all we
need.  In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert
into Unify as do not
Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking.  We spend a
great deal of time
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to
be cut as we need
it.  Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing
activity to 899??

Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.
I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.
This has to do with that TENN zone 4 deal that you e-mailed me about this
morning. Like I mentioned earlier, we never scheduled this gas, it was handled
on a back to back basis.
John Singer
FirstEnergy called to change the contract number for the sale I made to them
(originally to Belden & Blake) to be delivered to the Carroll Co Meter.  The
new contract number is 32082.
If you receive this email before you page me, that's what the page is about.
Call or email me with any questions.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jan sale to FirstEnergy @ Carroll Co Meter

We are agent for Enterprise, Petsec, and Pennzoil (Devon) on Stingray.  Petsec
and Pennzoil (Devon) are filling out the appropriate forms and should send to
you for your signature today.  There in nobody at Enterprise to sign the
form.   I am still working with Stingray regarding the agency between Enron
CES.  I thought this was taken care of but maybe not.  I am working with a
backup that is confusing.  I will follow up.  In summary, I think Enron will
have to nominate on CES contracts because I do not feel all this will get done
today.  Especially, Enterprise Oil.

As per our conversation today, we will set up a new service for contract
I00059 that will be "Park and Lend".
I talked with Scott Mills regarding the Sitara end; he said two tickets were
1.  An Exchange ticket with the counterparty "CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE" (when
done with the pipeline) and
2.  A Storage Capacity Ticket with the pipeline (CNG Sabine Hub Services) as
the counterparty.  This is where you
will set up the rate you have negotiated with the pipeline and the service
that Molly can path on so as to
get the correct rate for the service.
I will check with Kirk Lenart to confirm the correct way for Global to set
this up and I will let you know so you may select it on your deal ticket.

473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections
473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.
Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.
Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone
know the deal tickets by the end of the day.

DATE:	Thu, 23 Dec 1999 02:13:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
Here are the answers to your questions:
1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking
contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system.
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk
Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload
during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the
2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES
retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.  I would work with
McMichael's group who should be getting this schedule from CES Retail.
I have 2 storage questions for now.
1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite.
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol.  It was under the dresser in his bed room.
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.  It is
captured in a pistol storage case.  I stuck it in behind the sheets and
things.  I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.  They are a great couple.
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.  I am going
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he
wants to lease Dad's pasture.
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.  You had said we do not want to
pay for a fence along the creek.  When I have leased places in the past I
have had to build new fence at my own expense.  Most folk's base their
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.  If I built fence
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,
excluding my labor.  Something to think about.  I hope we do not own that
place for five more years.  Gerald also said he would mow the grass around
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up.
Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.  They placed her in
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation.  I think she required about
seven stitches in her head.  There were x-rays taken and her lungs are
pretty much gone.  Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can
read his prints.
Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.  Now where did they come up with a name like
that?  They removed the lymph glands from his neck.  Starting down the torso
just at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down the
torso about six or seven inches.  A triangle shape about the size of a piece
of large pizza.  The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep into
his body.  The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue.  They took a pretty
big chunk out of his chest.  He had a six " x eight " piece of skin removed
from his left thing for a skin graft.  It looked pretty painful.  He was in
good spirits and bull corning around.
I guess that is about it.  I would like to have a timber appraisal performed
on the Dad's place.  I'll be chatting with you guys.  Oh, I forgot the dang
remote to the TV.  I really was not for sure which one it was.  I think I
need it to program the darn thing.  Keep your powder dry.
Y'all be safe,

"Pet fish?!" the warden asked.
"Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let
swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their

"That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"
The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here,

"O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now.
The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.
After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said,
"Well, What?" the man responded.
"When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted.

Natural Gas Futures End Higher
Natural gas futures on the NYMEX closed higher yesterday as traders
sought to cover their short positions due to a feeling that the market was
oversold following the steep decline of the last several days. The June
contract climbed
was basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storage
injection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce an
addition to storage of about 100 Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could spark
a rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build.
However, an injection of over 115 Bcf could send the market to $4.00 in a
hurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose 58 Bcf, and the five-year
average injection is 61 Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, the
highest ever recorded was 78 Bcf in 1998. If current weather models hold up,
the Midwest and Texas will escape much of the summer's hottest temperatures,
and right now, temperatures are mild across most of the nation. Look for
technical support at the $4.20 level, and resistance is expected at $4.40.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada generally slipped
$0.10  $0.15 per MMBtu yesterday, except in the west where most spot prices
rose due to hot weather. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub

NOAA says last week's total of 26 heating degrees days was 22 less than
the previous week, 26 below normal and 12 below the same week last year. It
also reported a total of 24 cooling degree days last week, 12 more than the
previous week, 12 above normal and seven above the same week last year. The
latest NWS 6 to 10-day forecast calls for above-normal temperatures for most
of the West and Southeast, with below normal readings expected in the
Northeast. Seasonal temperatures were predicted for the Mid-Atlantic, upper
Midwest and parts of Texas, Florida and the Northwest.

Enron's Lay Calls for Open Access to Transmission Grid
Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, says that generators should have easier
access to the power grid. Lay spoke after receiving the US Energy
Association's 2001 US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have open
access to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the West
if we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power grid
throughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series of
separate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also says
FERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way that
natural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested in
energy infrastructure in the last 10 to 15 years, and it's going to take a
few years to correct that.
And now there's FASB 133.  So history will affect reported earnings, because
hedge efficiencies and derivative valuations will hit the bottom line.

Kinder Morgan and Calpine Offer 2 Open Seasons
for Sonoran Pipeline
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Calpine have announced that two open
seasons have begun and will continue through June 1st on the recently
announced Sonoran Pipeline.  A binding open season is being held on Phase
One of Sonoran - which would run from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico to
the California border - to give shippers the opportunity to commit to firm
capacity on the pipeline.  A non-binding open season is being held
simultaneously on Phase Two of the project - which would extend the pipeline
from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area - to give potential
shippers the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm
capacity to California delivery points.  Sonoran has received a binding
commitment from Calpine Energy Services for 400,000 Dth per day on Phase One
and a non-binding commitment for 500,000 Dth per day for Phase Two. The
proposed pipeline will be a 1,030-mile, high-pressure interstate natural gas
pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in
California and is projected to be in-service date by the summer of 2003.
Progas Storage Services, Inc
was recently organized to offer specialized natural gas storage services to
marketers and end users servicing the upper Midwest and Northeast market
regions along the major transmission systems in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky,
and Michigan. PGSMI has 10 bcf of potential working capacity which will
offer service along TXG, ANR, Midwestern, and is currently evaluating for
purchase another 21 bcf of potential working capacity which can be serviced
by these and other systems in the region. PGSMI also explores for natural
gas in the Gulf Coast region through a wholly owned subsidiary. Progas
intends to go public through a route of private industry offerings, and an
IPO or registration. For more information on services or the company mail

Power Suppliers to Meet with California Governor
Executives from energy suppliers are meeting with Californias governor
today, and several are willing to discuss concessions that include price
limits on power sold within the state. Last week the governor said he would
seek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions of
dollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigation
into alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discuss
limits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it is
prepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through the
summer of 2002. Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possible
alternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiterate
an earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at $20 per MWh if the
buyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy has
proposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state in
return for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices they
charged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, and
Williams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.

BULLS CAUTIOUS
In spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiously
bullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause
with the prospects of hot summer weather looming."This is a weak market, but
I think that below $4.60 you have to anticipate the return of industrial
demand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge
off the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gone
through a major change. Production has increased, storage  is higher, and
the injection last week at 102 BCF was the largest since June of 1998,' says
George Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. "I was skeptical of
the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when you
combine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balance
becomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wild
card is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. If
prices fell to $4.38 then that would be a reason to put on another 25%
hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chance
prices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be an
aggressive seller," he said.

Blackouts Hit California Again
California residents suffered through a second day of rolling blackouts
yesterday as temperatures soared, driving demand ahead of supply. The
California ordered that as of 3:10 PM the state's utilities must cut 400 MW.
Blackouts had been forecast by the ISO since early in the morning with the
heat coming at a time when many power plants are still off-line for
maintenance. The Los Angeles Department and Power, was as usual was excluded
from the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has more
than enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was running
about 1,000 MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projected
blackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two
500-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flow
south. About 700 MW produced by small suppliers, known as Qualifying
Facilities, are currently offline because they have not been paid. The hot
temperatures are likely to continue today, with the threat of more

Ernie, this is what I think.  ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO

with Peoples and East Ohio.  Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because
it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.
Comments, questions?
Ernie's on the team now.
Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade
behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go
away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;
Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?

Chris, have you gotten anywhere with this?  I really need to get this
It is a CES deal.  I have some support that Cindy faxed me.  What is your fax
number and I'll send it to you.
Thanks for your help
I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance
trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I
asked her to call me back.
Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved.  John Bieltz
is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this
issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me
as soon as possible as they would like to resolve.
Laurie Ellis
No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this.  My contact at Amereda Hess
(formerly Statoil) is John Bieltz.  His number is 703-317-2318 and his email
I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my
knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at
Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we
were not aware of.
Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient
awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria

U forgot to copy you brother.  I don't think he did it.  I think it just
kicked in somehow.
Ya'll reckon the old Coot had all this planned so if there was any problem
marriage, family etc, this automatically happened.   He probably did this back
when he was swapping land with Bertha and did not plan on us having to do this
again in the future.  MMMM, interesting.   Hey did he leave any of the land to
me or just you guys???
Spoke to Mary last night.  She's doing well and I know you both care.  She
said Bernie Max was in surgery for 4 hours on Friday to have a melanoma
spot removed from his collar bone - not good.  She found out about it
indirectly somehow.  Gerald and Shirley didn't know about the surgery
I should have an update on our legal issues by the end of the day.
I just spoke with "Wendy" in the Cherokee County Appraisal District.  She
said all of Dad's property was transferred to us back in August of 2000.  I
told her that seemed odd since the property was still in probate.  She said
that there was a special warranty deed transferring the property to us and
that Mary Esquivel had agreed to transfer the property.  Don't know how
that happened and don't care.  She also said that we need to fill out the
ag expemtion on both pieces of property.  The one I have is for the 31
acres.  Don, she will mail the other application to you at P.O. Box 532,
Brazoria  77422.  She will also mail a copy of the last application Dad
filled out.  We need to get the completed applications back to them in May
(does not have to be May 1).

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade
behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go
away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;
Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?
Chris, have you gotten anywhere with this?  I really need to get this
It is a CES deal.  I have some support that Cindy faxed me.  What is your fax
number and I'll send it to you.
Thanks for your help
I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance
trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I
asked her to call me back.
Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved.  John Bieltz
is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this
issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me
as soon as possible as they would like to resolve.
Laurie Ellis
No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this.  My contact at Amereda Hess

I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my
knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at
Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we
were not aware of.
Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient
awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria

This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.  I prefer a
shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.
Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money.
I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k.  How does the grass look up at
Dad's.  I am thinking we should maybe bale the hay.  I have intentions of
going up there this coming weekend.  You should have bought a boat during
the boat show.  I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat.  Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat?  Freshwater or
Saltwater.  I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha.  A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler.  I think the boat was around 21/23 '.  The sides were approximately
behind that which served as a seat.  It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom.  He
could run in about 8" of h2o.  If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha.  That baby would fly.  They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently.  You should call Duane Davis.  I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.
Buddy, did the Easter Bunny come to see you?

Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.  I had fun
at Disney.  The airshow was a bit of a let down though.  AND NO, I didn't
buy an airplane.  Now I'm thinking ... boat... yeah that sounds real good.
See what you can find me.
I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.  However, I checked new car prices on the
internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.  New
cars are so expensive.  So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.

According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show
below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal:
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65
Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after
paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the
prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone
SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02
(including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with
Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this
is a term firm sale to NYPA.
Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid
price  and the transport expense?

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.
Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR

Florida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at
Disney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was
pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.
Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.   And YOU ARE
CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.
Behave yourself girl.
Hey.. how's it going??
How's your back??? How was Easter???
I may come down for the TCO/Gulf meeting in May. Have to get the blessing of
my boss first.
Who is doing TCO pool??? The screen says John Hodge... he is really a nice
Is John (can't remember last name)... TCO appalachian guy from CES... still
at Enron?? Do you have his number?? I've been given the order to start
finding appal gas... what a joy. I thought I would give Jim Javins a call
Hope all is well for you.

Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.  I had fun at
Disney.  The airshow was a bit of a let down though.  AND NO, I didn't buy an
airplane.  Now I'm thinking ... boat... yeah that sounds real good.  See what
you can find me.
I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.  However, I checked new car prices on the
internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.  New
cars are so expensive.  So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.

Gas Storage Facility to Be Sold Immediately
A natural gas storage facility in Monroe County, Mississippi which is ready

deliverability. This project is worth considerably more than the $4.2
million asked by the owners, who need to sell it quickly.

Getting long means buying now - expecting the price to go up - and then

Surely you jest!  Oh, don't buy Lucent either.  I think they are preparing
to file Chapter 11.  Yea, I'll bet if I had not let Ma fall out of the truck
she would have really bragged on me.  I know.  Terrible.  I do recall her
spanking me a long time ago!!!  Today is Friday and I am happy.  Hey, what
is getting short mean?  I hear people speaking of this thing all the time
but I don't know.  Dow is kicking tail today.
I saw that mortgage rates rose today.  Did you really lose that much
money???  I would be climbing upon top of my DWS(dow work station) to jump
off.  That's my latest saying.  I am not making new paragraphs just
rambling.  Have a good weekend.
You are a good gradson.  I got a quilt out of Dad's closet and took to Ma
Monday night.  I was only there for 15 min and I bet she asked me 5 times
if I had a girlfriend.  By the 5th time I think I was telling her I was
married with 6 kids.  She only metioned you taking her for a ride 20 times.
I seemed to have gotten in on the wrong side of NYMX today.  I got short
around a $5.24 and the offer is now $5.395.  Let's see - I've only lost
$185,000.00 today.  Oh well, its just money I guess.  Its funny how unhappy
that makes me.
I'm gonna go pout now.

it to a delivered gate on TCO. Do I just pay GRI  once at TCO delivered
point. If I drop it off in TCO pool, then I pay the GRI there?? I can't seem
to get a straight answer from my accountants and TCO. It looks like our
model is adding the GRI at each leg... opps.
Thank you sweetie!!!!

Based on a request by Dennis Bond, a new report has been added that allows
external customers to see the group, name, and description for all reports
they can run.  The report is called RPT_GROUPS_EX (group Reports), and can be
run by internal users as well.  Only reports that are available to all
customers are included, so company specific reports will not be displayed.
Currently the report is 10 pages, and does not include a data file
(description
can be up to 200 characters, and doesn't fit well into a spreadsheet).  Dennis
wanted to be able to give new customers something to help them get started
the various billing report options.  Since showing all reports didn't require
that many pages, thought it might be helpful to include everything.  Good

DATE:	Tue, 20 Mar 2001 23:39:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
Let me know if you guys are receiving the Transco postings.
Re: Offers for Permanent Relinquishment of Firm Capacity in
Conjunction with the Momentum Expansion Project
As a part of the Momentum Expansion Project ("Momentum"),
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation ("Transco") is
soliciting offers for the permanent relinquishment of firm
transportation capacity on the Transco system from Station 65 in
Zone 3 or mainline receipt points in Zone 4 to delivery points
in Zone 4 or Zone 5 at or upstream of Station 165. Subject to
certain conditions, Transco intends to combine such relinquished
capacity with newly constructed capacity in order to render
service under Momentum. Offers for capacity relinquishment may
be made only for existing transportation services provided under
Part 284(G) of the FERC's regulations.
Valid offers must meet the following criteria:
1. The capacity offered must result in a reduction of the
facilities otherwise required to serve the subscribing
shippers under Momentum;
2. Inclusion of relinquished capacity in the project must result
in a lower cost of service for the project than if additional
facilities were constructed;
3. The remaining contract term for the relinquished capacity must
not extend beyond the 15-year primary contract term of the
Momentum service agreements;
4. Offers for permanent relinquishment will not be accepted from
shippers who nominate for service under Momentum;
5. Offers must identify the specific contract(s), MDQ, receipt
and delivery point(s) in each contract at which delivery point
entitlements (DPEs) will be reduced as a result of the
relinquishment of firm capacity to those points.  Shippers
will not be permitted to relinquish a geographic portion of
any contract; and
6. Offers must be unconditional, binding and irrevocable.
Such offers must be received by Transco no later than 5:00 PM
CST on Friday, March 30, 2001.  After receipt of offers to
relinquish capacity, Transco will finalize the design of the
facilities to be constructed to render service under Momentum.
Parties that submit offers to relinquish capacity will be
notified as to whether the offer complied with the
specifications set forth herein and whether the capacity will be
accepted and utilized to render service under Momentum.  If more
capacity is offered than is needed under Momentum, preference
will be given to those offers that reduce the cost of Momentum
to the greatest degree. In the event of a tie, preference will
next be given to those offers that have the shortest remaining
term for the capacity relinquished.
Shippers with relinquished capacity that is included in Momentum
will retain all rights and responsibilities set forth in their
Service Agreement(s), Rate Schedule FT and the General Terms and
Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff until Momentum firm
transportation service commences through the relinquished
capacity.  The relinquishing shipper's service agreements will
be terminated or reduced effective on that day. Transco's
acceptance of relinquished capacity is and will be subject to
the following:
1. Execution and delivery by the shipper to Transco of an
agreement to permanently relinquish such firm transportation
capacity (such agreement to be provided by Transco);
2. Execution and delivery of an amendment to the shipper's firm
transportation contract reflecting any modifications resulting
from the relinquishment of a portion of the service related to
such capacity, if applicable;
3. Execution and delivery of firm service agreements by shippers
subscribing to all capacity to be made available under
4. Shippers relinquishing capacity will file in support of
Transco's applications for a certificate of public convenience
and necessity authorizing Momentum;
5. Receipt of a FERC certificate authorizing the proposed
Momentum facilities and service (including approval of
shipper's capacity relinquishment) in a form acceptable to
Transco in its sole opinion; and
6. Placing the entire Momentum project into service.  In the
event that Momentum does not go forward for any reason,
including, without limitation, the FERC authorizations being
granted in a form unacceptable to Transco, the capacity
relinquishment shall not be effectuated and all related
agreements shall be null and void.
Parties desiring more information regarding this announcement
should contact Helen Laughlin at 713/215-3773 or Orlando

As you and I both know and discussed, New Power will manage what used to be
the old CES TCo and Gulf capacity starting in April, 2001.  We have talked to
the CDC's (COH, CPA, CMD, & CVA) have worked out the following with them:
CMD and CVA will recall all of the CES capacity on Gulf and TCo from you.
They will subsequently re-release it to New Power effective April 1, 2001.
New Power will execute it at that time.  This should happen late this week or
early next week.
CPA will not recall it form ENA and re-release to New Power.  Can you
permanently release all of that capacity at max rates to New Power as soon as
possible effective April, 2001?
For COH, the biggest pieces of capacity on TCo are FSS storage and
corresponding SST contracts.  They both expire in March 2001.  Therefore
nothing is required of ENA in terms of releasing them to New Power.
There is a contract with an mdq of 1,000/day primary from Leach to COH 8-35

max rates effective April, 2001.

"So Jesus called them to Him and said, 'As you know, the kings and great men

WHOEVER WANTS TO BE GREAT AMONG YOU MUST BE YOUR SERVANT and whoever wants
to be greatest of all must be the slave of all.  For even I, the Messiah, am
not here to be served, but to help others, and to give My life as a ransom
"The greatest among you will be your servant.  For whoever exalts himself
will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."  Matthew
"Now came an argument among them as to which of them would be greatest (in
the coming Kingdom)!  But Jesus knew their  thoughts, so He stood a
little child beside Him and said to them, 'Anyone who takes care of a little
child like this is caring for  Me!  And whoever cares for Me is caring for
God who sent Me.  Your care for others is the measure of your greatness.'"

Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240)
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had  to tranfer the
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at
Friday's P&L.  This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose
more than you think in Nymex.
On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals
Sunday's gain away from your book.
Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.
I think you have my NYMX value in backwards.
For the year
My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.  This
I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued

Article about CHK - company is very similar to TMR - I'm in both heavily....
Chesapeake Energy stock being sorely undervalued
By Melissa Davis
Business Writer
Ask the experts. Chesapeake Energy is more than a $9 stock.
Forget that Chesapeake is up more than 200 percent from a year ago -- and up
more than 1,000 percent from its lowest days, not long ago, when it traded
for less than $1. Chesapeake still appears sorely undervalued.
Last week, Chesapeake announced record fourth-quarter earnings that were
1,736 percent higher than earnings for the same quarter in 1999. The company
also reported a 2000 net income of $3.52 a share -- which means you can buy
Chesapeake for a price that is less than three times the company's earnings.
"No stock trades for three times earnings," said Mickey Thompson, executive
vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. "The
independent producers are all undervalued right now. Chesapeake is just the
most undervalued."
Chesapeake is the 10th-largest independent producer of natural gas in the
country. And natural gas, because of low supply and high demand, is one of
the hottest commodities on the market. It's a huge money maker.
So Chesapeake is in the right business at the right time -- and it's into it
heavily. Natural gas accounts for almost 90 percent of all the business that
Chesapeake does.
This has already caught the attention of some prominent investment experts.
Chuck Clough has picked Chesapeake as one of his favorite companies in his
current favorite sector -- natural gas. And Clough isn't just anybody. Until
a year ago, he was chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. Shortly
after he left, he established a hedge fund that returned 17 percent, after
fees and costs, during an 11-month time period when the rest of the market
slid -- and the Nasdaq tumbled 44 percent.
Clough's young hedge fund now boasts $150 million in assets.
He's not too worried about falling natural gas prices. He's invested 32
percent of his portfolio in energy stocks and most of that in natural gas.
He's convinced that companies like Chesapeake will begin trading for much
more than two or three times their earnings -- and soon.
Stephen Smith, a Houston analyst for Dain Rauscher Wessels, considers
Chesapeake to be a top performer among the energy companies he covers. He is
convinced the stock is undervalued and that -- even after gaining 326 percent
last year -- Chesapeake will have another banner year in 2001.
"Natural gas prices don't have to stay at $7, $8, $9 or $10 for them to have
a good year," Smith said. "The prices could drop to $4 or $5, and that would
still be a wonderful doubling of what they used to be. If we can continue to
see $4 gas prices, then I think that energy stocks -- and particularly
Chesapeake -- will start to respond a bit more."
Thompson, who moves within local energy circles, is very optimistic.
"The natural gas prices we lived with for most of the '90s will never come
back," he said. "I can see a scenario with $4 and $5 gas prices for a long,
long time."

From:  Sanvido, Terry
Would you please look into this.
From:  Kelly, Katherine
Dan; Townsend, Judy
Unless I'm missing something, it does not appear that there is a way for us
to run a CPR report that shows all business done on a particular pipe
regardless of desks.  For example, if I want to see all business that is
being done on Transco, I must run the report for both the Northeast desk and
the Market East desk.  This next weekend, the east is to be split into 12
different desks, which will only complicate the issue even more.
Russ Severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll into
one position manager.  Is there any way that we get something similar from
the reporting environment.  I'm thinking that the easiest way might be to
have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk
first when submitting a report.
Please let me know your thoughts on this.

SUBJECT:	St. Mary's VPP - Texas Gas Operational Flow Order [OFO]
DATE:	Thu, 22 Feb 2001 23:36:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
St. Mary's gas flows on Texas Gas [TGT].
On January 26th, TGT issued a Critical Notice, that in essence states that
they will not accept a nom to flow gas if it doesn't meet certain pipeline
spec criteria - they will not accept gas over 1050 Btu content.  St. Mary's
gas is around 1085 Btu.  Thus, this gas will have to be processed at the
downstream Eunice Plant, or it will be shut in, starting either Monday the
26th, or March 1st - this is uncertain right now.  I am working with Charlie
Otto [Fred's group] and Jay Hartman/Brad Strong to put a processing contract
together.  Charlie has/or is working on a processing contract with Hunt
[operator] and this contract will be pretty much the same as Hunt's
processing contract.  Since gas HAS TO be processed in order to flow, there
is not much negotiating that will be done.
Since the price of gas is high [and producers do not want to process] , in
the last couple months, there have been several pipelines to issue OFO's re
Btu content.  This is the first time that I know of that this has ever been
such an issue.
Terms of the processing contract:  $0.10 fee, shrink/PVR will be about 12%,
producer keeps 100% of the NGL's.  Per Charlie, he thinks that this 12%
shrink/100% liquids equates to a $0.05 or $0.06 loss.  Thus, the cost of
processing is expected to be around $0.15 to $0.16.  The processing contract
will be month to month and used only when it is mandatory under the OFO.
St. Mary's will be responsible for all fees, and shrink.  As an example, if
100 is flowing at the wellhead, and 60 is VPP.  then, there will be 60 as
VPP, 12 as PVR/PTR [shrink], and 28 as excess gas.
St. Mary's would like the processing contract in ENA's name, since ENA should
have title to the gas as it goes thru Eunice, and would just reimburse ENA
for the 10 cent fee, or any other actual applicable fees.  Teresa - can you
put something together re this reimbursement.  Charlie sees no problem in
putting this in ENA's name, if someone sees an issue with this, please let me
George, Melissa, Lia - we will need to start nom'ing PVR/PTR.
Chris Germany - do we need a PTR contract on TGT?
Teresa - per the Production & Delivery Agrmt, it states that St. Mary's
cannot process their gas.  We will need a waiver to this section 4, for the
time period that processing is mandatory.
Lia, George, John - the OFO notice came out on January 26, and I heard about
this via Charlie today, is there some way in the future we can be notified
more quickly about possible issues re the flow of any of our VPP gas?
Charlie will get his first draft of the contract on Friday and will work with
myself and Jay/Brad to get this put together on Friday, in case this OFO does
go into effect on Monday.
Anyone with any questions or concerns, please contact me immediately.

Can you get the deal ticket for me on this deal please?
I just wanted to follow up on this.  We must settle this by Friday for
correct payment on Monday.
Bill Murray of Columbia Gas of Ohio called and stated that the Demand Charge
that is a part of deal #213360 has already been paid by Enron as a put or
option premium in Apr-00.  He is stating that it should not be part of this
month's charges.  Please advise and/or change this deal to reflect your
understanding as to the correct charges on this invoice to Columbia.
Please respond to both Janine Cashin and I.  She is the new coordinator for
this account and will ultimately settle with Columbia.

DATE:	Wed, 21 Feb 2001 05:40:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
We should have included the ACA, GRI, and Great Plains in our sales price to
Midcoast.  You should still use the $.0792 in your calculation.  Just a note,
we could have shipped this gas to a zone 4 market, resulting in a much higher
transport cost, OR we could have sold the gas at the wellhead, giving us a $0
transport cost.  Most of the time you will use the IT feeder cost ($.0792 in
this case) regardless of what we do with the gas.
By the way, Transco's rates changed just a bit effective 2/1/2001.  The IT
unchanged at .45%.
Tricia Spence
First, let me start by saying I miss seeing your happy face every day!! Now,
that being said, I have a question!!!
Juniper Energy is one of the producers we are marketing consultants for.  I
have the pleasure of preparing their invoices for them every months on the
EI57 meter that is nominated on Transco, Zn3WH (ticket 547342).
The agreed upon purchase price from Enron is Transco Sta 65 less transport
and fuel.  In the past months, we have nominated this gas on one of our IT
contracts and the transport fee reflects the max IT rate of .0792 plus .45%
fuel.  That is what I subtract as a fee from the Gas Daily price to reflect
what Enron owes Juniper for purchasing the gas...
In January, from the 13th - 16th, we nominated 2009/day from EI57 and
transported it on IT contract .2774 for delivery to Midcoast Marketing, Inc.
This path incurred a higher fee than the other two paths that were nominated
either to our pool or to Mamou.
The Ethel Midla delivery fees included:
GP .0097 (great plains surcharge ??)
The pool and Mamou delivery fees only included:
My question is....are any of the Ethel Midla fees passed on to the delivery
counterparty, Midcoast Marketing, Inc. ?
Or, is Juniper responsible for paying for the extra fees?
Thanks for your help

I would have sent flowers to my beloved in Ohio if someone would have given

REDNECK VALENTINE!
Collards are green,
my dog's name is Blue
and I'm so lucky
to have a sweet thang like you.
Yore hair is like cornsilk
a-flappin in the breeze.
Softer than Blue's
and without all them fleas.
You move like the bass,
which excite me in May.
You ain't got no scales
but I luv you anyway.
Yo're as satisfy'n as okry
jist a-fry'n in the pan.
Yo're as fragrant as &quot;snuff&quot;
right out of the can.
You have some'a yore teeth
for which I am proud.
I hold my head high
when we're in a crowd.
On special occasions,
when you shave under yore arms,
well, I'm in hawg heaven
and awed by yore charms.
Still them fellers at work,
they all want to know,
what I did to deserve
such a purdy, young doe.
Like a good roll of duct tape
yo're there fer yore man,
to patch up life's troubles
and fix what you can.
Yo're as cute as a junebug
a-buzzin' overhead.
You ain't mean like those far ants
I found in my bed.
Cut from the best cloth
like a plaid flannel shirt,
you spark up my life
more than a fresh load of dirt.
When you hold me real tight
like a padded gunrack,
my life is complete.
Ain't nuttin' I lack.
Yore complexion, it's perfection,
like the best vinyl sidin'
despite all the years,
yore age, it keeps hidin'.
Me &quot;n&quot; you's like a moon pie
with a RC cold drank,
we go together
like a skunk goes with stank.
Some men, they buy chocolate
for a Valentine's Day,
they git it at Wal-Mart,
it's romantic that way.
Some men git roses
on that special day
from the cooler at Krogers,
that's impressive, I say.
Some men buy fine diamonds
from a flea market booth.
&quot;Diamonds are forever&quot;,
they explain, suave and couth.
But for this man, honey,
these won't do.
Cause yo're too special,
you sweet thang you.
I got you a gift,
without taste nor odor,
more useful than diamonds....

Worker dead at desk for 5 days
Bosses of a publishing  firm are trying to work out why no one

okay.  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a
proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack
in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  He
quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until
Saturday morning when an office cleaner  asked why he was
still working during the weekend.  His boss Elliot Wachiaski
said "George was always the first guy in each morning and the
last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in

always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  "A post

days after suffering a coronary.  Ironically, George was
proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

SUBJECT:	DTI (CNG) Storage Offering.
DATE:	Mon, 5 Feb 2001 05:07:00 -0800 (PST)
BODY:
Read and file.
I met with Jeff Kiester of DTI yesterday regarding the storage offering they
have on the market.  They have 3 Bcf storage capacity and 30,000dt/d of
FT-GSS up for bid by 2/12/01. However there will be up to an additional 10
Bcf of storage capcity available before 4/1/01 depending on additional
turnback.  All of this capacity is utility turnback mainly, East Ohio,
National Fuel and RG&E.
Potential uses for DTI storage:
1.  Desk use - If we buy the storage without the transportation we would
inject and withdraw at SP.  If we do submit a bid, I would recommend that we
try to incorporate free intramonth injection capability, effectivly giving us
a no-notice type service that we could use to take physical positions in the
cash market.  The current park/loan rate is $0.07 /dt/d, it seems we utilize
this 2-3 times a month.
2.  VNG - AGL could want to look into adding storage to the VNG portfolio,
the drawback is that the PL1 line has no excess deliverability, VNG's need is
more a peak day issue.
3.  Partner with EES - Paul Tate from EES also sat in on our meeting, he
expressed an interest in looking into potential partnering oppourtunities
with the East desk regarding markets on TCO and DTI.  This storage offering
for example could be something we partner on.  I plan to meet with Paul at
the beggining of next week to discuss further (Dick I will check with you on
your availability).
Jeff also indicated there will be more transportation capacity turned back in
the near future.  There will be a posting for 75,000 dt/d of Lebanon - Leidy
capacity coming out in the next few weeks.
Market view on capacity release:
With the utilities turning back transportation, the economics of the capacity
release market will change.  The utilities have historically released
transportation in the summer months for $0.05 or less (as low as $0.01) in
order to recover something from their asset.  DTI will now be the marketer of
the turned back capacity.  Historically the pipeline has been very reluctant
to sell capacity below max rate in the winter and less than 50% ($0.12 at
current rates) in the summer.   Jeff indicated that his view is that capacity
values will increase slighly this summer and significantly next summer due to
the new power gen load coming online 2002.  As part of DTI's last rate case
settlement FT-GSS holders can no longer release transportation in the summer,
that went into effect last summer-00.  Although the capacity release market
was a little tighter last summer it did not significantly drive up capacity
release prices in the summer-00.  My view is that two of the three power gen
loads will be interuptible and therfore will not sigificantly increase the
overall load factor of the system.  The bottom line is that DTI is competing
with capacity release and I feel there will be enough capacity release
available on the market this summer to force DTI to sell it's capacity below
50% of max rate.  However capacity release prices may increase next year as
more utilities turnback capacity and the new power generation may be in the
capacity release market.
Market View on Basis on CNG for Summer 01 & Summer 02:
With the increased load and potentially low storage inventory level going
into this summer, basis could be strong vs historical prices. However, with
the inception of M&NEP delivering 400,000dt/d into the Northeast last year
CNG basis (summer strip) was less than $0.20 in Jan-00 and Feb-00,  even
though the April 1 storage inventory level was the lowest since 1996.  In
1996 CNG Apr-Oct strip traded as high as high as $0.31 in Feb-96 and dropped
as low as $0.21 by May-96.  DTI summer load is averages 2.5 - 3.0 Bcf, I
don't think the 100,000dt/d load of the new power gen load will be
significant this summer considering the additional supply coming in from
Dracut.   However with American National Power Inc (34,000Dth/d) and El Paso
Gas Services Co (139,000dt/d) both coming online in 2001, that have
contracted for around half of the Dracut supply, this may cause sumer basis
prices to increase from current levels (Apr-01-Oct-01 strip $0.33) this
summer and depending on storage inventories 4/1/02,  Apr-Oct-02 basis may be
also get stronger.

RE:  HIGH BTU LEVEL ON THE LAROSA LATERAL
Tennessee is encountering high BTU levels on the Larosa Lateral.  These high
levels have been the subject of customer complaints that the delivered gas
is interfering with the proper operation of various lines, regulators,
meters and appliances located on the Larosa Lateral.  Beginning, with the
January 11 Gas Day, Tennessee requests point operators of receipt meters
located on the Larosa Lateral to tender to Tennessee gas that meets the gas
quality specifications found in the General Terms and Conditions of the
Tennessee Gas Tariff.
The following is a list of receipt meters located on the Larosa Lateral:
012021  Red Fish Bay Transport
Absent resolution of the problems, beginning with the January 11 Gas Day,
Tennessee will not accept nominations from meters on the Larosa Lateral
tendering out of specification gas and will issue an Operational Flow Order
Balancing Alert to the point operator.

Leidy beginning in 11/1/01 at the same time the first phase of Transco's
MarketLink begins.  The first phase of MarketLink has a capacity of 166,000
Dthd and the second phase is scheduled to begin 11/1/02 with an additional
130,000 Dthd.  Tennessee was the successful bidder on a recent open season
that National Fuel had for 19,100 Dthd of space between Niagara and Leidy.
Tennessee has executed a 10 year lease for the space.  They will use this
capacity and a 10 year lease arrangement that they are finalizing with
Dominion Transmission for Ellisburg to Leidy capacity to form the basis of
their CanEast Project.  The Dominion lease will allow Tennessee to use
unsubscribed Zone L to Zone 4 capacity and deliver approximately 260,000 Dthd
from the Gulf Coast to Leidy.  (Dynegy negotiated an index-based, revenue
sharing contract with Tennessee for delivery into Dominion using this
negotiating with shippers to subscribe to the CanEast capacity.  They are
willing to negotiate contracts less than ten years and have negotiated terms
that synch up with the second phase of MarketLink.  This should allow
available capacity from the Gulf Coast or Niagara to Leidy or secondary
delivery points such as Dominion (since Phase I of MarketLink is set) for one
year contracts.
As a reminder, firm shippers with binding contracts on MarketLink are:
Phase I (11/1/01 start)   Volume  Delivery Point  Comment

Transco has until the end of April 2001 to file additional binding executed
contracts with the FERC for an additional 404,000 Dthd of Leidy to New York

the 296,000 Dthd of the first two phases.

little in Jan to see if it will go as we need reliable supply for CPA.

BODY:
I don't see the facility numbers in Sitara.  However, I do use meter numbers
and the NFUL meter number for the interconnect with TCPL is 010902.  Deal
Market East sale to ENA-Im Ontario) is also at this meter for December.  It
doesn't matter to me which facility we use provided NFUL meter 010902 is set
up in Sitara.
Richard, issues to consider before Faye makes any changes,
*  NFUL is an EDI pipeline, how will the changes impact Angie's EDI file?
*  Will we need to rebook our term purchase - (this should be fairly simple)?
*   Will Unify need to be repathed since the beginning of time?
*  If Martin reads this without Darren tipping him off before 1:00 PM today,
I'll buy him a "pop".
Kevin, I have included Chris Germany and Richard Pinion because they
requested updates to facility #820006.  There is a note on this facility from
Chris requesting this facility to be reactivated (10/28/99).  He would have
to approve inactivation.  Richard requested a name change (4/25/00).
Chris is this still a valid point?
See Screen 3 - Facility #513423 appears to have been created in error.  The
Norm and Trade flags are set to 'no'.
Please let me know.
Screen 1 - Note requesting reactivation.
Screen 2 - Shows interconnect with different pipes.
Screen 3 - This facility appears to be created in error, both the Norm and
Trade flags are set to 'No'.
820006 is set up in Global as an interconnect between NFUL and TCPL at
Niagara Falls.  That is incorrect and this facility should  be changed or
inactivated ASAP  before any more deals get booked against it.  I believe
there is an interconnect between NFUL and TGP at Niagara.
Didn't we have this same problem in the spring regarding Facility#513423.

Pipeline VNG k#  ENA k#  MDQ   Comment
CGAS - we may not release any VNG CGAS capacity to ENA.  According to CGAS,
we may loose some of our flexibility with the contract.  Scott is waiting to
hear from CGAS.  At this point, we will not release the capacity effective
for the 1st.
Tenn -  I do not have the new contract numbers yet.  Per Tenn - Scott will
send a letter to Tenn requesting that the VNG discounts be transferred to the
new ENA contracts.
Trco - Trco has a capacity release "glitch" in their EBB and needs to
"temporarily flip a switch" while I do the capacity releases.  Since I know
Trco well, I've decided to wait until after the 1st to do the releases in
case their are EDI issues with the "switch flipping".  AND we would not know
about any problems until the 31st.
Also, VNG has 35,930 dth of telescoped Trco capacity.  Williams has 15,930
dth of the VNG capacity because of the FS service.  I will release 20,000 dth
to ENA.  This will eliminate the overlapping problems we have with Williams.

Could you please send the service agreement into Koch for the Ormet
transaction.  This memo that I wrote to Scott details the rates that we have
negotiated with Koch.  Koch has to post our deal for five days, so could you
please try to send it out today if at all possible.  I am also sending you
the draft letter agreement that Koch sent to us which we will also need to
execute.  We will also need to put an IT agreement in place with Koch.  They
have offered the same discounted rates on an IT basis for any volumes above
Also, could you please arrange to put in place an IT agreement on Cypress for
delivery to Ormet Aluminum's Burnside,LA
Thanks for your help.
Craig Breslau
Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypress.
The transport rates that  Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows:
From Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis .03 demand charge
from Venice     .05 demand charge
from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch .045 demand charge
(if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a .0246
gathering fee on Mobile Bay)
In addition we will be charged .0022 ACA from any of these receipt points.
The fuel rate is 1.6%.  This will be passed on to Ormet.
Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the
same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.  If this IT is cut, we
still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or
on Cypress.  Ormet pays all additional transport costs.
Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly
balancing at any point during the contract term.
I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event
that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the
gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).  If you have any preferences
for alternate delivery points, please let me know.
As I mentioned, we  have already quoted NYMEX + .055 as the all-in delivered
price to Ormet.
Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is
due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).  They are one
hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.
Thank you for all of your help on this deal.

This is the first notice from Transco regarding imbalances.  Transco has not

Media Inquiries: Chris Stockton
Re:     System Imbalance Notice
Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive negative
transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of receipts) on its
system over the past several days.  As of December 21, 2000, Shippers
are advised to avoid any additional negative imbalances as soon as
Additionally, until further notice, Transco will institute more
restrictive practices at its pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4%
tolerance currently allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for
Shippers with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will continue to be held
to the 4% tolerance levels.  Transco will not enforce these pool
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however,
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits identified
above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may proactively decrease
markets to bring them in line with supplies at pooling points.
Absent voluntary compliance with this notice, Transco may be required to
use any remedies available, up to and including reliance upon Section 52
of the General Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff, to
ensure it retains the appropriate level of operational flexibility.

AGL/VNG is fine with your proposal to release the assets for three years

The last problem deals I see are 516286 and 521475.  This is not a bookout,
One of these should be killed and I think it should be the purchase deal
516286.  We should see New Power scheduling gas out of our pool.  The volume
on the 5th - 31st should be about 40,257 day.  Just a note, since I think the
purchase deal should be killed, this would make us 520,000 shorter for the

BODY:
I just spoke with Joann and this is what we are coming up with on CGAS.
Est Citygate for Nov  43,213
Storage Withdrawal  15,000
Net Purchase from ENA  28,213
Does this look correct?
We would enter a citygate sell to New Power for 43,212 and a purchase from
New Power of 15,000 (grossed up for fuel).
AND, Dave, it looks like you might have 3 or more worksheets that you are
maintaining.  Do you want to try and do away with any of them?  All I really
need are the FOM numbers buy pipeline buy pricing zone.

BODY:
Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for "Third
Party"  buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did
on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.  Not a big deal for
October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again
for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party
gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.
Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your
transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel
and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what
the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on
the worksheet.
So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.

Chris, I just figured out why you did not see the e-mail, I did not send it
Sorry, here it is.
A friend recommended Capacity Center, a service that e-mails information on
capacity release, daily activity reports and system notices from pipelines on
a daily basis.  There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline,
time frame and the critical nature of  the notices.  The cost is based on the
number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months
the cost would be approximately $3,000.  If you would like to check it out  I
have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 11/5/00).  Click here

reports I can forward them to you via my e-mail.  Or you can call

We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary

She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide
the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's

we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.

Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from
Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I
may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables
are netting to 0.
For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match
the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment
to Clinton.
Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to
make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these
deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money!
Gloria G Barkowsky
Do we know yet how we are going to handle this problem??

Wade, for July and August, give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips
and Power Gas Marketing behind Peoples.  AND are these volumes MCF's or
MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?
Gloria G Barkowsky
Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So

RE:     2000 Winter Operations and 1Line Meetings
You are cordially invited to attend one of Transco's three regionally
scheduled 2000 Winter Operations and 1Line meetings.
The meetings are scheduled as follows:
Gateway Hotel
Charlotte Hotel
This year's Winter Operations Meetings have been expanded to include a
variety of material that will be of interest to all customers. The meetings
will focus on three specific areas:  (1) the traditional update on
operational plans for the winter, maintenance outages planned for next year
and a customer service update; (2) a 1Line update and discussion on business
practice changes that will require tariff changes; and (3) a review and
discussion of the EDI and flat file datasets for nominations, confirmations
and schedule quantity reports targeted at those customers and their
information technology staff who have expressed an interest in this
information.  Transco will also be holding a pre-filing meeting in
DC specifically to address the tariff changes associated with implementation
of the 1Line system.  That meeting will be held in mid-November and
will be notified as to time and location in the near future.
The meetings in Newark and Charlotte will start at 9:00 a.m. and end at
approximately 4:00 p.m.  Coffee, juice and pastries will be provided before
the meeting and lunch will be served at approximately 11:30 a.m.  The
meeting will start at 12:30 p.m. and end at approximately 5:00 p.m.
Refreshments will be provided mid-afternoon.
The agenda for the Newark and Charlotte meetings as well as the Houston
meeting is included below.  Please note that the agenda for the Houston
meeting is significantly different than the other meetings.

There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably
be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.
How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his

A Service Verification is a statement created in the Settlements module of
Unify.  The Volume Management group uses this statement to approve a payment
to a pipeline for a transportation related expense.  The Service Verification
shows an amount calculated on quantities for a contract in Path Manager,
times a rate from  either the Unify Tables or a rate on the Sitara deal
ticket.  I could put a zero rate on the Sitara deal ticket to zero the
unnecessary expense out but this doesn't resolve the issue.  Since we are
noming agent only, we don't want something coming across the system for
calculation of a payment.  Is there a different way to handle these types of
contracts when they are being entered in Path Manager?  I've heard of
something like a point nom as way to handle.  Are we doing that on this

Refunds are always so much fun.  I suppose we would need to give some back to
BUG if this happens.
Just wanted to make sure all of you saw this notice that we posted on the
bulletin board last week.? This may mean significant $$$ for some of you.? In
brief, we are filing a request to make an early partial refund.? The refund
is related to the rate of return settlement in our last rate filing.?
According to the rate case proceedings, the refund is not due until a final
non-appealable order is issued, but we are requesting permission to do a
partial refund sooner (around Oct 31).? As the bulletin states, if your
company wishes to wait to receive its full refund after the final,
non-appealable order, please notify me or another Transco rep.

Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to
??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds
In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a
Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial
Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion,
Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the
January 20, 1998 Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to
make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting
Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return
Issues on or about October 31, 2000. The refund is being made to
parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set
forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate
the effects of current high natural gas prices on their
customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to
Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets.
Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on
or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 1997
through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the
Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No.
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues,
subject to the "refund floor". These interim partial refunds will
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon
If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non-
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on
or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in
the interim partial refunds.

Re:  Texas Gas Transmission Fuel Retention Effective 11/1/00
On August 31, 2000 Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas
Gas) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-518-000
to change the Effective Fuel Retention Percentage (EFRP)
under its Rate Schedule FT which Transco utilizes to render
service to its customers under its Rate Schedule FT-NT.
Texas Gas has proposed to change its EFRP from 3.37% to
3.27% for the Winter Season (November - March) and from
2.68% to 2.96% for the Summer Season (April - October). If
accepted as proposed, the revised Texas Gas fuel percentages
would result in the following changes in Transco's current
Rate Schedule FT-NT Fuel Percentages effective November 1,
Winter Season - 0.09% decrease
Summer Season - 0.26% increase

Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from
Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I
may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables
are netting to 0.
For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match
the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment
to Clinton.
Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to
make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these
deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money!

Wade, for July and August, give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips

MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?
Gloria G Barkowsky
Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So

Isabel Y Resendez
Bay State did paid for the gas in full.  We were invoicing them the demand
charge on top of the gas cost. They just did not pay the demand. So they do
not owe us any of the gas cost.
Should there be demand charge entery on the purchase side?

When did Bay State bill ENA for this?  And, did Bay State pay there bill for
gas ENA sold them or did they deduct this from the payment?
It does work out to 5,500 dt per day at $.09.

Hello Chris,
Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed
about a week ago?(deal # 233091)  Well, the demand charges need to be in the
purchase side not the sales side.  Per Bay State, Enron should be paying the
demand charges.  Are they correct???  Bay State is also charging interest for
late payment.  Please let me know if you need any more information.

RE:  Iroquois' 7th Annual Customer Meeting, October 4-6, 2000
Just a reminder that TODAY, September 21, 2000 is the cut off date for
hotel reservations at the Mystic Hilton for Iroquois' meeting.
If you haven't done so already, you can make your reservations online
**  or with Hilton Worldwide at 1-800-HILTONS
Use the group code "IGT" to get the Iroquois rate of $135.  After today
we cannot guarantee room or rate availability.
Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about the the lack of rooms on
Wednesday night at the Hilton.  The golf was originally planned for
Friday afternoon but we had to move it to early Thursday morning because
of the holiday weekend, and could not get additional hotel rooms for
Wednesday night because of another conference.  There are still plenty
of rooms left for Thursday night.
If you are coming on Wednesday night, it is suggested that you make a
reservation at one of the alternate hotels in the area and ask to be
waitlisted for available rooms at the Hilton.  The alternate hotels are
listed on our website at
four properties listed and the Residence Inn are less than a mile from
the Hilton.
While you're at it, if you haven't already RSVP'd for the meeting,
please do so by September 28.  You can register online at
online and did not receive an e-mail acknowledgment from Lori Rauser,
Please contact me if you have any problems with accommodations, or any
other questions about the meeting.  We look forward to seeing you in

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of

Just an FYI update on the Iroquois 06/26 parking issue.  This might be
redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on 07/26/00 that we
cycle of 06/26/00 (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), & the cut
volume was placed into PALS.  As I understand it, the late notification was a
us when they found out.  Anyway, the 364 MMBtu's are on the August
Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn,
incurring parking charges of $173.77 for the month (364 MMBtu's x 31 days =
item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, & this
parking charge is related, & so, may be disputable.  Either way, the volume's
currently not in Unify as parked, & will not show up on the Service
Verification at present.
Are there any updates to the status on this item?  Thanks.

my fault.  The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about
the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely
notification by any means.  I think that Chris was looking into this issue
with Colleen Sulllivan, because of the late notification.  I will badger
Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week
after the dust has settled from the 1st.  Thanks for understanding.  -Angie

I entered a demand charge on deal 396265.  This is a Market East desk deal.
I tried to enter a demand charge on the original deal for Oct 1999 but I kept
having problems saving the deal so I created a new one.
Let me know if this works.

Do you know the deal number for this October 1999 demand fee?
Can you push this demand item through Unify?
I just spoke with Chris, he's going to put the deal into sitara as a parking

Good job Chris.
My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.

DATE:	Thu, 7 Sep 2000 08:20:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 8/1and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we
are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the
delivery points.
I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the
month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt
and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it
and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impact
on what we flow in Z6.
Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let
me know if you need specific capacity examples.

This has to be a retail contract that we are not using.

Beverly Beaty
My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries.  They are
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.  The
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among
other things.
Chris Germany
As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity
contracts effective 9/1/2000.  I don't think we should make any changes to
the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.  However, we will
need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in
Sitara.  Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand

BODY:
Wade, I have decided that everything currently in our system is incorrect.
Please set up a meeting with all the people shown above and we will discuss
how to correctly handle this in our system.  We also have some other supply
behind the LDC that we might as well handle correctly.
Wade, while we are at it, do you want us to look at NYSEG, CPA, and East
Ohio??? Any others?
People I need in attendance
Mary Theresa or Jeanne
Steve Gillespie
Sylvia Campos (or someone from the contracts group)
This is what I'm thinking, everyone please think about this before we meet.
I think I will have Peoples set up as a pipeline and we will move all the
deals to this new pipeline.
Steve, get the Peoples password from Angie.  I need you to go into escript
(Angie can help you with this) and run anything you can get out of this
system.  These are actually CES passwords.  It is my intention to use this
information to set up transport or pooling contracts in Sitara.
Phillips Production has/had two seperate PNG deals:
To my knowledge, PNG does not send out production information to either the
producer or the pool operator.  This information should be available on
Phillips gets their production volumes (which they use to create our
invoice) from the company integrating the meter charts.  I beleive that this
is the same information provide to PNG.
Wade,  Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. But I need help
understanding this one.  We have a process already to handle John's behind
the citygate deals
Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia,  we never nominate
this gas nor do we see actuals.  We hear about them from John and Terry and
we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.  Whenever one of
these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to
account for these transactions internally.
It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the
citygate deals;  that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.  The offset also
entered by Terry  is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept.
1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.  Angie
schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual.
Is that not the case here?  Is this something that's getting reconciled in
Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG???
By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.  THANKS!
Please keep me abreast of the status.
Wade R Price
ENA is being invoiced by Phillips Production Company for production on
Dominion Transmission (CNG) via Peoples Natural Gas.  This is

I need a volunteer.  The "Vol" will be responsible for pricing all of The New

Who wants it?  Certain people have expressed an interest in learning  more
about pricing, Tricia Spence, Joe Casas, and Beverly  Beaty.
I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month, and about
4-6 hours during bidweek.  I also believe this deal will go away effective
Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing
guru like myself.
Will learn a great deal about transport pricing.
May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over
until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing.
Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con)
Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the
Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be.
May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions.
I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer.
I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend, AND I'm
very detail oriented.
I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the

Doug, we billed you incorrectly for June on the CGAS storage.  We should have
billed you for 1,089,289 but we only entered 497,015 in our system.  We will

the theoretical storage services under our 12/99 Agreement with ENA.
is a file that I prepared showing the theoretical storage injections for the 4
storage services as they appear on ENA's monthly invoices.   I note that the
June injection for the TCO storage appears to be only about half of what we
requested and what appears in our GMS system.  My ultimate objective here is
provide The New Power Company with  definitive estimates of the end-of-July
inventories (including left-over inventory from last winter) as well as the
volumes "injected" in July alone.  I hope the attached file helps.   If we

We sold directly to Clinton for the term of our deals.  Clinton (Latrove)
should have pulled directly from Power Gas Marketing's pool.  The Power Gas
Marketing supply deal ends Oct 31st and the local production deal ends Nov
30th and then we will be out of the local production business.  We've tried
to tell everyone but I bet you still get phonecalls until we are out of it.
Did we end up doing this deal or did you sell directly to Clinton?  I'm
thinking that you sold directly to Clinton....  Let me know.  Thanks!  md
Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes -
it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel.
I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object
to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call.
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.
Questions that I have:
1)  I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool.  It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.)  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.
2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.
3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?
4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.
2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.
Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.
Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?
2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.
As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.
Phillips Production is also down..
For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

Tenn/Colden (meter #060003)  Tenn Zone 5 close to the Niagara Spur - we can
use Dracut supply or Iroq/Wright supply.
Tenn/Lamont (meter #020072)  Tenn Zone 4 - we can use Cook School for this or
Dan can flow long haul - Cook School is baseloaded into CNG.
Trco/Leidy - we currently have 1,000 dth from CGAS going into CNG - we can

Thanks for pointing this out.  To my knowledge we have never even tried to
overlap the contract or do any segmenting.
Any concerns to forward to Becky Cantrell by Friday the 11th of Aug.???? We
contract #125008, an IT contract and a parking and loaning contract to handle
our Canadian term supply.  We typically transport to markets off Iroquois, to
Tennnessee pipeline and CNG pipeline.  That is a simplified summary of our
daily activity on Iroquois.  If you need any information, please let me
As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago,
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented
capacity.  Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement
shipper.  Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not)
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible.  For instance,
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy
to complete within GISB timelines.
Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on
Iroquois' system?  Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?
Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments
on this issue.  I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

This deal (#227738) was booked in our system on Jan 17th.  According to my

price deal and it goes through September.  The volume is 5,000 per month for
April through August and 20,000 per month for September.
CES sold the physical gas back to ENA.  The only gas CES has are the Exhibit

Chris--There is a recurring set of monthly transactions on ENA's invoices that

I created deal 348393 (sale to EES).  This deal should get matched with the
purchase from Power Gas Marketing, deal 264613 for July and August.  The deal
volume is 10,000 for the month.  We have the Power Gas deal thru October.  We
still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone.
I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is 0, so I entered an
expected volume of 0 on the EES deal.  I didn't want to mess anything up so
close to nom time.  Please put 10,000 for the month on both deals for July.
I changed the volume on deal 264595 to 3500 for the month.  This volume
fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume.  This
deal also goes through October.
We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company.  I did not
see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434, the price needs to
be corrected.  This deal goes through November.  The estimated volume for
August is 300 per day, this volume also fluctuates each month..
We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton, deal 348443.  The price on
this deal is CNG IF per mcf.  Clinton will pay us based on actuals.

Do you know if all this gas was simply turned around and sold to CES?  And do
you know if we have made any progress on getting these deals into the system?
FYI - John Singer wants us to pay this based on volume he is providing in a
spreadsheet.  To do thatm, Gloria will have to put this in Unify, and won't
have true pipe support.  Are you comfortable with that?
Attached is the backup fro the Jan, Feb and Mar for Belden & Blake's NYSEG
invoices.  I created these spreadsheets from the information given me by
Heidi Boyd, who was the person nominating this gas for CES.  Belden & Blake
invoiced ENA base on these spreadsheets.
The NYSEG gas is a back to back purchase/sale to CES.  There should be a
deal for the sale in the system for the sale.  Check with Chris Germany.
There are three price scenarios for the gas.  Should there be a spereate
deal for each price?

I was wondering if you could forward to me a list of all of the pipeline
capacity and storage assets that you have on behalf of CES.  I am in the

Credit is an issue.  To better know how much credit NPC needs, I thought it

SUBJECT:	Segmentation And Order 637 - Houston Meeting
DATE:	Mon, 24 Jul 2000 01:13:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
Hi Gang.  Transco has a shipper meeting next week in the afternoon.  I will
probably be out all week.  I believe Scott Goodell and Beverly should go and
take anyone else that would like to attend.
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line System (Transco)
RE: Modifications to Capacity Release Processes and Segmentation
and Order 637 Compliance filings
On June 30, 2000 Transco made a compliance filing with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in Docket No. RP00-17-000.
This filing proposed several changes to the Capacity Release and
capacity segmentation procedures that are to become effective for
business beginning gas day September 1, 2000.  A customer meeting
will be held in Washington DC on August 1, 2000 at 10:00 a.m.
(please see the Transit posting dated July 14, 2000) and in Houston
on August  3, 2000 at the Williams Tower, Level 5, Dining Room C
at 1:00 p.m.  The Houston meeting will address both the segmentation
changes and highlights of Transco's Order 637/637A Compliance filing,
with segmentation being discussed from 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. and the
Order 637 discussed from 3 p.m. - 5 p.m.  In order to finalize
the appropriate arrangements for the meeting, Transco requests
There are two key elements to the proposed changes
1.  Use of "Master" FT-R Commodity Contracts
Transco will no longer use the "Master" Commodity Form of Service
Agreement for reservation rate capacity releases.  Historically,
Transco has required capacity release shippers to execute two FT-R
contracts upon their initial acquisition of released capacity:
the FT-R Demand contract and the FT-R "Master" Commodity contract.
With subsequent reservation rate releases, shippers were only
required to execute new FT-R Demand contracts.  Each FT-R Demand
contract was specific to a capacity release deal and the FT-R
"Master" Commodity contract was used for all nomination and
commodity billing purposes.
Effective with business for gas day September 1, 2000, Transco will
require shippers acquiring capacity through reservation rate
capacity releases to execute and nominate transportation on each
new FT-R Demand contract.  This will require new activities to be
created for each capacity release contract.  For any capacity release
deals that span the August 31 - September 1 period, nominations for
gas day August 31, 2000 will be on the existing "Master" Commodity
contract and nominations for gas day September 1, 2000 will be new
transactions on the FT-R Demand contract.  Additionally, all
commodity billing will be done on the FT-R Demand contract.
Transco will send a "Notice of Termination" to all FT-R "Master"
Commodity contract holders identifying the contract that will
terminate as well as a list of all of the FT-R Demand contracts
that will continue to be effective in September.
2. Limiting nominations within a segment
Consistent with FERC's ruling in this docket and consistent with
similar rulings on Tennessee and Texas Gas, Transco will limit the
quantity of gas that can be scheduled  IN ANY SEGMENT of the
pipeline to the original firm contracted capacity.
Transco will aggregate all nominations under an original FT
contract and any related capacity release contracts
(or subsequent re-releases) to ensure that the total scheduled
quantity for the family of contracts is within the original
contractual entitlement.  If nominations for the family of
contracts exceed the original entitlement, nominations using
any secondary capacity rights will be considered as secondary
nominations and subject to cut on a pro-rata basis.
As stated above, Transco intends to implement these changes for gas
day September 1, 2000.  In the event systematic changes cannot be
completed or the FERC directs Transco to modify its planned
implementation, Transco will notify customers via TRANSIT of any
business practice changes as well as the expected implementation
If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact
your Customer Services Representative or Scheduling Analyst.

assuming pool N424PB is the CES/ENA non-priority pool.  Let me know if we
need to do anything different on our side.
Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.
I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000
for the month.

With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly

Hi Paul and Chris,
Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

If you stay under the CES name, business should proceed as usual.  If you
switch, keep in mind:
For the Columbia Choice programs, the utility is required to release to the
party responsible for billing Choice customers.  For July- Columbia Maryland,
Columbia Virginia, and Columbia Ohio released space to CES then I would
re-release the capacity to ENA for nomination purposes.  This would refund
the original shipper the demand charges, then ENA would receive the transport
charges and bill CES direct.  Do you have an entity for Columbia Gulf and
Columbia Gas for this?  If you do, please submit paperwork for ENA to have
agency rights.  If not, call Erin Scott at 713-267-4212 to set up your
business party.
For Atlanta Gas Light, said they will continue to release to ENA, unless told
otherwise.  Releases begin 7/19 for August allocations.
I will be out of the office 7/13, returning 7/21, so call Chris with any
Please Take Charge

SUBJECT:	PNG Local Production July 00
DATE:	Tue, 18 Jul 2000 09:23:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.
I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000
for the month.
AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.
Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas.
Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly
Let me know what you guys think.
Hi Paul and Chris,
Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

DATE:	Mon, 17 Jul 2000 06:33:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??  EES and ENA
used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do
this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free
lunch and my New Power golf shirt?
Are you still willing to provide assistance for establishing New Power to do
business on the interstate pipelines?  I would welcome the help if the offer
is still there.  Talk with the appropriate individuals internally and give me
a call at your convenience. Since ENA is doing all of the nominating upstream
at the moment, there is not a tremendous sense of urgency.  However, I would
like to move ahead on this quickly anyway.
I would see TCO, Transco, Sonat and TETCO as first tier requirement.  CNG,
NGPL, ANR and Panhandle are probably on the second tier.
Thanks Chris.

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but why is the pipeline set up as CGAS

we turn the noms into CGAS who then gives them to KO?  It's been a long time

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio

this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks
like this pool can be terminated.
Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer

Hey Team.  Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans
market and we still have the production.  For July, take all of this gas into
CNG.  You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara.  You
should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup.
You are all wonderfull people  - I will make this free pop Friday (Wooo Hooo).

I recommend that CES have ENA match the pricing for each package that has
been bid.  This means that we will let the unbid portion of capacity remain
under the posting.
Please copy me on your e-mail to ENA.  Thanks
This should do it. I believe the BGE Rate Schedule on CNG is GSS. Call if you
need more info.
I will have a discussion with Dick Jenkins on Tuesday afternoon.  I will
see what he can offer to us in terms of of bundled delivered package.  ENA
has 23K a day going to Zone 5.  They should be willing to deal.  Is there
anyway you can take a stab at what our position is from Nov 00 to Oct 01 by
zone and op, less the winter storage and SST that we own?  I need a good
idea what our needs are.  I could compile this myself but I am loaded up on
finalizing the deal on Monday.  Thanks
Surprisingly, 12,485 of our 15,500 dth/d of capacity that TCO had put out
bid, has been bid on for between the minimum, $5.171 and $5.1807. CES
agent, to tell TCO whether we want to match those bids for the next year or
it go to the bidders.

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG.
I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price
adjusted for dth??
I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES -
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as
I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing
Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be
matched with the CPA local production deals.
Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.
East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should
know the actual volume in the next day or so.
Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.
National Fuel
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.
CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

Hey Team.  I need the following services set up on National Fuel.

Believe me, this all happened really fast.  I just sent some of the paperwork

Chris Germany
We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS.
We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to
keep the tickets balanced.
Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy,
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.
Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at
today's prices that cost about $.105
Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055,
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.
Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.
Let me know if you have any questons.

capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at
today's prices that cost about $.105
Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055,
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.
Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.
Let me know if you have any questons.

BODY:
Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes -
it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel.
I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object
to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call.
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.
Questions that I have:
1)  I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool.  It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.)  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.
2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.
3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?
4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.
2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.
Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.
Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?
2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.
As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.
Phillips Production is also down..
For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

Can you take a look at the attached spreadsheet that NIMO has sent regarding

There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to
Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?
Chris Germany
ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.
Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I
believe its in the deal correctly.
Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or
something real intelligent like that.

Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport
CES actually has.  There should be some big changes in CES's transport

we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.  Any credits

SUBJECT:	CES Supply Management Agreement
DATE:	Fri, 2 Jun 2000 04:07:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
Hi team.  Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.  May not be a
problem but just in case.
New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.
1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will
only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" as
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.
2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I
agreements.
3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for
un-utilized capacity.
4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only
transactions would not be subject to this clause.
I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your

BODY:
It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year.
If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES
- Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has
been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized
Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with
the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES
'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use
the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered
with the CES prefix.
John, can you fill in the missing details?
John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG.
I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price
adjusted for dth??
I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES -
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as
I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a

Its good we didn't book anything because CES just sold a lot of their

I definatley think we should book these volumes for all of your reasons below
plus each month we don't seem to have a decent estimate until the 30th or
Here is your problem in getting these booked.  You can do what you want, but
I still think we should book it.  The flexibility in takes is only 10% so
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't
book anything.  Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to.  In addition, per our
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year.  This
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term.  And finally, what if
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in
Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you
I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are
not reflected in the books.  Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to
book since there is flexibility in the takes.  Also, he said he has a strong
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it.  Dick
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now.  So Chris
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we
should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal
227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the
credit either today or tomorrow.

APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE
Dear West Virginia Producer,
Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.
For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE
compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405.
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.
Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should
be included (please print or type).
Forward this information to:
Joseph A. Thompson
Manager, Business Development
Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
500 Davisson Run Road
After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close
I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at
have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.

APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE
Dear West Virginia Producer,
Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.
For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE
compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405.
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.
Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should
be included (please print or type).

Per our discussion on Monday, we need to give CES-Retail a bid for the two
TCO transportation contracts that were dedicated to c&i customers that they
will no longer need once they sell their c&i business effective 6/1/00.  As
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that
this information is accurate.
I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest
that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements.  I think
this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it
up!!).    If there is any problem with this, please let me know.

New Virus Taking Offices By Storm
This virus warning is genuine.
There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort
of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a
colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.
This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have
been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their
social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you
do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to
purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough
of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically
forget the "work".
If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and
drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to
the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum
punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work"

The STOCK MARKET closed sharply higher on Thursday following the
release of today's report on retail sales for April, which was down.
Today's report eased trader fears about rising interest rates
however; it is unlikely that it will cause the Fed. to abandon its
current policy of higher interest rates until there is further
evidence of a slow-down in the US economy. Technically, today's
action appears corrective in nature leaving the door open for
sideways too lower prices on Friday. It will take closes above
trendline resistance crossing near 10,760 to temper the near-term
bearish outlook in the Dow.
JUNE BONDS closed higher on Thursday following today's release of
friendly retail sales data. This week's rebound off the 62%
retracement level of this year's rally crossing at 92-31 has allowed
June to challenging initial trendline resistance crossing near 94-09.
Multiple closes above this resistance level would signal a minor low
might be in place.
CRB INDEX surged to new highs for the second day in a row confirming
Wednesday's trading range breakout above 217.88. Sharp gains in
energies supported today's rally in the CRB, which has renewed its
long-term uptrend. I would not be surprised to see the CRB trade
sideways too lower on Friday as it consolidates some of this week's
gains and possibly retest broken resistance at 217.88. However, this
week's move to new highs has opened the door for a possible test of
weekly resistance at 223.23 later this month.
CURRENCIES the June Dollar closed higher on Thursday following
Wednesday's late-session turnaround. The setback off last week's low
as the appearance of a potential bull flag. Closes into new highs
would confirm an upside breakout of weekly resistance at 111.37,
which would open the door for a possible test of the 1981 high at
114.88 later this spring. The Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on
Thursday with the D-mark gapping down and closing below long-term
support at .4624. Closes below last week's lows in both markets are
needed to renew this spring's declines. The June Japanese Yen posted
a key reversal up after session lows fell short of the Feb. low at
.9125. Additional gains on Friday would confirm today's reversal
pattern however; June needs to close above .9394 to confirm a
short-term bottom has likely been posted.
PRECIOUS METALS closed mixed on Thursday. June gold posted a new low
close for the week and in doing so turned a number of short-term
momentum indicators bearish. Follow-through weakness on Friday could
set the stage for a possible test of May's low at 273.60 in the near
future. July silver closed lower following Wednesday's inside day
increasing the odds July will try and test this spring's double
bottom at 4.975. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for
sideways trading on Friday. July copper closed slightly higher on
Thursday after probing last week's gap. Momentum indicators are
overbought and turning bearish warning bulls, time is running out and
downside risk is increasing. Closes below gap support at 82.40 would
confirm a short-term top has been posted.
GRAINS closed higher on fund buying and NOAA weather forecast. July
corn posted an inside day with a fractionally higher close as traders
digested Wednesday's bullish long-range weather forecast from NOAA.
Light consolidation ahead of Friday's supply/demand report also
limited today's gains. NOAA is still calling for a potential drought
this summer, as LaNina is likely to persist through August. A steady
too higher close on Friday sets the stage a possible resumption of
last week's rally next week if hot/dry weather returns to the
Midwest. July wheat gapped up and closed sharply higher for the
second day in a row due to strong fund related buying. Expectations
for a friendly supply/demand report on Friday and bullish weather
forecast have been the driving factors behind this week's rally.
Today's close above minor resistance at 2.78 1/2 makes March's high
at 2.84 July's next target, then this winter's high at 2.95 1/2. The
rising ADX signals additional short-term gains are possible during
SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed steady to lower due to consolidation ahead of
Friday's supply/demand reports. July beans posted an inside day in
relatively quiet trading ahead of tomorrow's reports. Never the less,
this week's rally is turning a number of short-term momentum
indicators neutral too bullish leaving July poised to renew this
year's rally if the weather turns hot and dry next week. Closes above
spiked to new highs before light profit taking tempered today's
meager gain. Today's high-range close leaves July poised to extend
this month's move to new highs if Friday's reports come in neutral to
friendly. July bean oil closed lower on Thursday in narrow trading as
the market remains poised to extend its decline off May's high should
Friday's reports come in neutral to bearish. Today's bearish export
sales report does not bode well for the longer-term outlook in bean
oil. If the decline resumes, the 50% retracement level of this
spring's rally at 17.50 is July's next target.
LIVESTOCK closed lower on Thursday pressured by weaker cash and
product prices. June hogs closed slightly lower but near session
highs as the market attempted to consolidate recent losses amidst a
sharp rebound in bellies. However, lower cash bids and additional
long-liquidation limited to day's rebound as the market is
consolidating above minor support at 71.96. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling further losses are possible later this
month. June cattle closed into new lows for the week confirming
Wednesday's trendline breakout. Today's close below April's low at
68.22 sets the stage for a test of March's low at 67.70 in the near
future. Expectations for rising grain prices and declining boxed beef
prices continues to weigh on prices.
FOOD & FIBER closed mixed on Thursday. July coffee continues to drift
sideways ahead of the May 19 retention plan meeting. July sugar
closed on spec. buying on ideas world surplus should continue to
shrink due to lower production levels in Brazil and other sugar
producing nations. Profit taking ahead of the close tempered today's
gains. July needs to close above 675 to renew this spring's rally.
July cocoa gapped up and closed higher due to fund short covering.
Today's high is challenging this spring's downtrend line crossing
near 830. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to
confirm a bottom and trend change. Momentum indicators are turning
bullish signaling additional gains are possible. I would not be
surprised to see an inside day on Friday as July consolidates some of
today's gains. July cotton posted a potential key reversal down on
Thursday after session highs fell short of testing the 75%
retracement level of this spring's decline at 62.76. Today's
mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday.
Bullish short-term weather forecast for West Texas and the southeast
US will continue to underpin prices. Momentum indicators are bullish
and suggest additional gains are possible.
The ENERGY MARKETS closed higher on Thursday with July heating oil
posting a new contract high today. July crude oil has retraced over
75% of this spring's decline setting the stage for a possible test of
March's high at 30.46 later this spring.

I need to know WHY you all are still uncomfortable using the service p&l, at
least for demand charges.  Please advise.
The main reason I am uncomfortable about using the service p&l is because
Chris, Dan, and Judy are uncomfortable with it.  As soon as they are happy
with it, we are ready to use it.
Why are you still not comfortable using the service p&l, at least for demand
What system resources are you talking about?
I think the reason that they haven't moved has been one of timing.  Chris has
not had time to pull them out of their spreadsheets and put them onto
another.  This, of course, has led to the obvious point that we are still not
comfortable using the service P&L from unify.  When Scott gets back next
week, we will together with him and Dick to verify what needs to be moved and
take care of it manually until system resources can handle it.
Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market
area pipes to the Market East p&l?  If the only reason is that you're not
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion.  It seems to me that there are
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee,
Texas Eastern and Transco.  For now, why don't we leave all the demand
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East
book:  Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG,
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.
Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to
make sense to me.  Please advise.

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of

There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.
Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I
believe its in the deal correctly.

SUBJECT:	Storage on TCO - PLEASE READ
DATE:	Fri, 12 May 2000 09:57:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had
a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have
misstated something, please let us know.
There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum
withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached
spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know
its different volume requirements.
Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum
Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ)  based on Enron's SCQ. There is no
Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO.
TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ;
If you add these months up, the total Injection is 115%. Essentially,
shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection
period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is
5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done).
For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April
(15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to
catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the
ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval
(I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve
overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus
overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full.
Some other basic rules;
Shippers do not have to fill storage 100% by October.
Shippers cannot have more than  60% in storage by June 1st, unless
overinjection is approved by TCO.
Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same
way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the
MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324.
Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember
Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need
to be used to avoid overrun charges.
Why do we care about all of this....
Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still
uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for
Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay
below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we
will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for
overinjections above 36,304.
TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far.
April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems
running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run
the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these
reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or
overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a
volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing
penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt.
Please save this note for future reference.

I think this same memo is on the EBB several times.  FYI
Dear West Virginia Producer,
Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into
gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited
of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity
somewhat more widely available to the producers.
For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:
For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering
and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig,
Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion "bubbles"
for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there
does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor
stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the
compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the
applications
it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion
recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time
We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the
application
process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once
granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity
will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for
incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will
award the rights on a prorated basis.
Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be
included (please print or type).
Forward this information to:
Joseph A. Thompson
Manager, Business Development
Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
500 Davisson Run Road
After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after
June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after
I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of
your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at
have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.

SUBJECT:	Sea Robin Well Head Curve
DATE:	Mon, 8 May 2000 07:56:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
Hi gang.  We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin.
I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea
Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La
curve to value everything else.  Per my discussion with Christine, the
following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;
Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions.
Here is the thread on the Sea Robin Curve
I think the best thing to do would be to create a separate zone for all of
those ISRP meters.  The traders typically take deals from ISRP to the Pool
and incur transport.  Therefore having two zone would more accurately
represent what is actually happening.
I am in London helping Brent Price with some audit work that he is doing.
Imelda Frayre
Well, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different
than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility
mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently.  Currently,
there are 137 active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of
ISRP.  That would mean I would have to create 137 alternative facility
mappings.  Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to
their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone.
However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities
would have to change the zone on every single facility record.  Plus, we
would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we
would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities
made it's change.  So, let me know what your thoughts are.  What are you
doing in London???
I am in London right now, and dont' have access to a phone.  The only part of
Sea robin that should be moved are the meters with a prefix of ISRP.  I'm
sorry if that wasn't clear.  Please let me know if that will be a problem to
Imelda Frayre
David, Sea Robin Pool is a zone on the Sea Robin Pipeline (SEAR).  The Sea
Robin Pool zone includes many different meters some of which do have a prefix
of ISRP.  However, there are also other meters in that zone that have the
following prefixes: LSRP, FSRP and PSRP.  I mapped the entire zone to the new
curves you sent us.  Given your message it seems like things might not be
peachy after all if you only wanted the ISRP meters mapped that way.  Please
call me as soon as you get a chance.
Imelda Frayre
I am not sure if Searobin ISRP is a meter level location or Zone level, but
as long as only Sea Robin Pool ISRP locations are mapped to the new curve,
then everything will be peachy.
Dave - they called me on this to see if it was a meter mapping or a zone
mapping.  I said zone.....
KARIE HASTINGS
Imelda and Karie,
The East desk traders have asked me to set up a new curve for the Sear/Sea
Robin Pool/ISRP zone.  The curve is already set up in Erms.  Please do your
sitara voodoo to map the above location to this new curve.

Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES.  Cora gave
a description of the invoice below.  Let me know what you think.
The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title
transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user
customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer
fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.

I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this.  Originally they wanted to
do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a
different service type (so as not to change historically).  To my
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was
cleared with Connie Sutton.  So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.
Chris Germany
Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change
the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound
correct to you?
Please let me know.
Per our conversation....
I trust you're on top of this.....let me know if you'd like my help!
National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.
1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

BODY:
What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective
new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe
that has already been done)?

I was not aware ot the Sonat Style.  In that case, an IT request is not
Marlene Hilliard
Richard Pinion
I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this.  Originally they wanted to
do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a
different service type (so as not to change historically).  To my
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was
cleared with Connie Sutton.  So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.
Chris Germany
Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change
the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound
correct to you?
Please let me know.
Per our conversation....
I trust you're on top of this.....let me know if you'd like my help!
National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.
1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.
Thanks, Diane

please get together so that we will have the appropriate forward quantities
re: CES retail  in the book.
Here's the first one that was sent to Mark F. on 3/1/00.
We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.
Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.
If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please

SUBJECT:	Update from India
DATE:	Thu, 27 Apr 2000 09:17:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
Greetings from India.  Just a brief update to let you all know what is
happening.  This week I finished a 3 week teaching course on the Book of
Romans, with 8 students from one of the schools in Kodai.  I think that is
the most exciting thing I have ever done in my life.  I asked the students
one day who lead them to Christ.  Everyone single one of them have been
saved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing in
their school over the last year.  But what was even more exciting than that
was the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family.  All of the
others were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family.
That young man's name is Anifa.  He came to Christ through one of the
pograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown so
much, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion to
Christ.  Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord.  Anifa
will honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole school
knows that he is a man of prayer.  Recently Anifa asked me if I would teach
him how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go back
and reach his people for Jesus.
Until Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated,
because I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won a
single Muslim to Christ.  Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because I
have won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others.
Please be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates,
and a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler.
They will be coming in June and July.  We will be starting 2 new Churches,
and ministering in the schools.
And please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that was
started last summer by the team from Southwestern.
I look forward to seeing you all this year.  Angela and I are praying about
God's direction for our future.  Please pray with us that for God's guidance
as we plan for our future together.  God bless.

Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know

Doug, I'm killing both of these deals.  The BG&E has been changing all month
on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance.  The CNG changes were made
yesterday it sounds like.
Chris Germany
I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG.  The CGAS deal is number
250938, the volume is 257, the delivery point is BG&E, and the price is
$3.53.  This deal is for 1 day only.  The CNG deal is 250897, the volume is
51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples, and the price is $3.60.

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was

estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.
Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I
believe its in the deal correctly.

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!
Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial

SUBJECT:	CES Daily March Requirements for 4/3 and 4/4
DATE:	Thu, 20 Apr 2000 02:19:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   4/3
(Intraday)     and 4/4  .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with
today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes in this spreadsheet are not
current and should be ignored.
The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Chris Germany
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.
2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.
3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill
CES directly for this?
4.  See attached worksheets.
5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she
will recreate Jan - Mar.
6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has
discussed this with Melissa.
Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.
1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.
2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.
3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.
4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)
5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?
6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?
There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they

Well, now that I am somewhat settled into my new home (I'm still trying to
hunt down a giant slip-n-slide for the backyard), it's time to throw a
party.  This Saturday, April 15th at 7:30 pm, I will have my first official
party to put the first beer stains on the new home.  Let's keep this pretty
simple and painless, everybody just needs to bring a little something to
drink and I will provide the rest.  I will have directions sitting on my desk
to figure out how to get to Pearland, for all you inside the loop people
don't be afraid, it's not that difficult and long of a drive.
If you have any questions let me know and please pass this on to anybody I
may have left off the list.
Hope to see you all Saturday,
Directions:
Take 288 S to the Pearland exit (CR 518) and take a left off the exit (going
east).  You will stay on 518 for 1.2 miles.  After you come upon your third
stop light you will make a right, this will be CR 90 ( there will be a strip
mall on your right with a Domino's Pizza on the corner).  Travel on 90 for
1.8 miles until you dead end.  This will take you to CR 101, which you will
take a left on.  Stay on CR 101 for 0.4 miles until you see Kennedy Rd and
take a left.  My house is the first house on your left-hand side once you

Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4
capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We
have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets.
According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's
meter in Zone 4.
I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we
need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01.
I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it
because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge.

DATE:	Thu, 13 Apr 2000 03:41:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
Hey guy, please copy Scott Goodell and Molly on anything you send me in the
future.  Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals.  Her email
The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.   Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.

The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that

This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for
storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is
a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the
same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The
deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the
withdrawals.
Which brings up the following issues;
*   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES
at the storage facility.
Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for
storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.
* How do we track the storage balance in Unify?
* How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will
bill on the net injections/withdrawals

The reason for my question is due to a comment in cell 34 S of spreadsheet
that says, "For Retail needs".
Chris Germany
NO.  CALP is a wholesale contract.
Brenda H Fletcher
Do you invoice CES Retail for the monthly and volumetric demand paid by ENA
Chris Germany
This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.
Which brings up 2 important points;
1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss
this with CALP (and she may have already)
However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.
Comments/questions?

(using new fuel rate).  Maybe I'm calculating it wrong!  Tell me how you

DATE:	Mon, 10 Apr 2000 11:15:00 -0700 (PDT)
BODY:
Hey guys.   I have a ton of emails to plow thru with CES buy look what I
found.  The CES storage proxy schedule is at the bottom.
Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2:  The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue.  Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.  I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.  I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.  Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.
3.  Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.   Here is what is happening:  Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.  That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers.  So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations.  We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want).  For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.
4.  Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you.  Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges.  This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.  Let us know what
you would prefer.  Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29.  Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.  I apologize for the delay.
5.  Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday.  Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you?  If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.
Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
I forgot the storage attachment ...
Melissa Flewellyn
Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.
Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.
1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.
2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.
3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.
4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.
Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.
